00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:47,689
Oh, right... prison.

15
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:54,291
I cannot
<i>believe you.</i>

16
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:56,236
Making a scene
like that.

17
00:00:56,385 --> 00:00:58,052
We weren't trying
to make a scene!

18
00:00:58,138 --> 00:01:00,713
We were just...
dancing...?

19
00:01:01,054 --> 00:01:02,197
Connie?

20
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:04,088
What have you
done with Connie?

21
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:07,127
What have I done?
What have you done?

22
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:09,462
You're the one that wanted
to keep those organics

23
00:01:09,548 --> 00:01:10,861
from the Kyanite colony.

24
00:01:10,963 --> 00:01:13,234
I'm just the fool
that let you.

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,335
What?

26
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:16,635
Now your little pets
are chasing

27
00:01:16,736 --> 00:01:18,475
the pearls up
and down the halls.

28
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,538
What were you thinking...

29
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:22,388
Letting them loose
in the ballroom?

30
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:24,077
They could be anywhere.

31
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:27,609
- Bah!
- Ah! Eee!

32
00:01:27,873 --> 00:01:29,265
Pink!

33
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,156
Ugh. Please.

34
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:35,507
Just get rid of it.

35
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:40,179
Pink...

36
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:43,452
White is very unhappy
with you.

37
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:47,882
If this keeps up, she's going
to take away your pearl.

38
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:50,195
I know.

39
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:52,038
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:55,461
Huh?

41
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:58,991
Why do you always do this,
Pink?

42
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:01,242
Huh?

43
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,234
Huh?!

44
00:02:19,997 --> 00:02:22,083
No, stop!

45
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:41,237
Oh, Connie,
you... you're here.

46
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:46,119
Yeah.
Can't exactly leave...

47
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:55,480
I cannot believe you...
Making a scene like that.

48
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,603
Whoa... deja blue.

49
00:02:57,748 --> 00:02:59,519
We didn't mean any harm.

50
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:00,988
I asked Steven to dance.

51
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:02,753
He wasn't trying
to cause trouble.

52
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:05,495
What do you know
about this, human?

53
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:08,282
You think I've never
been grounded before?

54
00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:09,690
"Grounded"?

55
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:11,558
Blue, you gotta
let us out of here.

56
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:12,769
We're gonna starve.

57
00:03:12,855 --> 00:03:15,503
"Starve"?
What is this?

58
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:17,289
Another made up problem?

59
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,542
Another trick,
so I'll cave and let you out?

60
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,923
Well, not this time.

61
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:23,558
You're
not leaving this tower

62
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:26,355
until you apologize
for fusing at the ball.

63
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:29,581
No.

64
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:34,084
- Steven.
- What? I'm not sorry.

65
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:36,546
We finally
have you back...

66
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:39,683
and you're worse
than ever.

67
00:03:41,382 --> 00:03:42,456
Steven!

68
00:03:42,548 --> 00:03:44,823
It's fine, Connie.
I'm not even sad.

69
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:47,210
But you're
really dehydrated!

70
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:50,073
Blue, Connie and I
fuse all the time.

71
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:51,651
It's totally
normal and fine.

72
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,691
Agh! In what universe
could that possibly be fine?

73
00:03:56,855 --> 00:03:57,955
This universe!

74
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,505
The crystal gems fuse
all the time, too.

75
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:02,763
Blue, you gotta tell me
where their gems are.

76
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,626
They didn't do
anything wrong.

77
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:07,308
Oh! Pink!

78
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:10,964
Your time on Earth has warped
your sense of right and wrong.

79
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,894
Yeah, maybe it has.

80
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,323
Maybe Pink thought you guys
were right to lock her

81
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:16,823
in here when
she messed stuff up.

82
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:19,389
But I know what it's like
to have a loving family,

83
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:21,933
and we don't do stuff
like this to each other.

84
00:04:22,132 --> 00:04:24,784
The crystal gems understand
that I'm Steven,

85
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:26,912
and they support me
and Connie.

86
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:29,573
And you guys poofed 'em
for sticking up for me.

87
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:31,175
That isn't normal.

88
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,056
That's enough!

89
00:04:37,306 --> 00:04:39,253
This isn't normal.

90
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:41,948
How many times did you
lock her in here?

91
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:44,690
How many times
did you make her cry?

92
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,558
I didn't, I...

93
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:53,409
And I'm doing it again,
aren't I?

94
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:02,933
And this is why you left,
isn't it?

95
00:05:10,073 --> 00:05:11,740
You were right to leave.

96
00:05:13,653 --> 00:05:17,789
I always thought that
you were failing this world.

97
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:20,511
But if you were
happier on Earth,

98
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:24,886
maybe this world
was failing you.

99
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,999
We never should have
brought you back here!

100
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:31,046
Your "family,"
your "crystal gems" are bubbled.

101
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:34,296
Let's get you all
back in your legs...

102
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,429
and back home.

103
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,161
All right, it's safe.

104
00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:46,958
Food!

105
00:06:02,513 --> 00:06:05,380
Good-bye, Pebbles.
Wish us luck.

106
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:10,107
I'm ready.
We've got friends to save.

107
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:32,302
What... are you doing?

108
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:36,427
I'm taking back my friends!

109
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:39,286
What are you doing, Blue?

110
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:41,810
Take Pink
back to the tower.

111
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:45,441
She prefers to be
called "Steven."

112
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:49,630
What are you
talking about?!

113
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,080
You can't keep bending
the rules for her, Blue.

114
00:06:52,172 --> 00:06:55,466
She has to set an example.
And we have to set an example.

115
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,279
If we bend the rules for her,
we bend them for everyone.

116
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:01,396
Well,
maybe you should.

117
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:06,036
Take them back
to the tower, now!

118
00:07:06,153 --> 00:07:08,068
I won't.

119
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:10,333
Then I'll do it myself.

120
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,505
Blue?!

121
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:17,831
Ugh!

122
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:26,855
Steven, now.

123
00:07:33,563 --> 00:07:35,223
When we thought
Pink was shattered,

124
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:38,960
when she abandoned us,
I alone was there for you.

125
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:42,555
And you would use
your power against me?!

126
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:58,180
They're free.

127
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:01,204
Come on, guys.
You're not bubbled anymore.

128
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:04,126
You can come out.
Are they okay?

129
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,164
You'd hurt
a fellow diamond?!

130
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,060
Didn't we hurt Pink?

131
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:13,916
She was suffering
in silence for ages...

132
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:16,346
Just like our gems,
just like me!

133
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:20,102
And I know you're
suffering in silence, too.

134
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:32,809
Stop!

135
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:38,848
You don't have to do this.
Yes, I do.

136
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:41,809
This is what White Diamond
expects of all of us...

137
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:46,317
From a thin flake of mica
to the deepest, hardest stone...

138
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:50,932
We all must make sacrifices for
the sake of our perfect empire.

139
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:53,215
Does this look
perfect to you?

140
00:08:58,322 --> 00:09:01,567
My dad says if every
pork chop were perfect,

141
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,348
we wouldn't
have hot dogs.

142
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:04,986
And that means what?

143
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:08,316
It means if you try to make
this empire perfect,

144
00:09:08,543 --> 00:09:11,896
if you just wipe away
everything you see as flawed...

145
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:14,395
you lose all the things
that make you happy...

146
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:15,734
Like hot dogs.

147
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,824
Or our Pink.

148
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,356
Uh...

149
00:09:22,705 --> 00:09:24,152
Stop.

150
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:27,692
Stop it, Blue.

151
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:31,043
Stop using
your power on me.

152
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:32,590
I'm not!

153
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,869
Steven, come on.
Grab the gems.

154
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:50,258
Let's get out of here.

155
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,437
Right.
I hope they're okay.

156
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:54,939
Amethyst would usually
be back by now.

157
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:56,627
They'll be out
for a good while.

158
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:58,543
They took
a direct hit from me.

159
00:09:58,705 --> 00:10:00,935
Yellow, we've got to
get them out of here...

160
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:03,565
before White finds out
about any of this.

161
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:07,308
Right. Quickly.
Your legs are this way.

162
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:11,346
Don't worry, guys.
I'll get you home safe.

163
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:13,409
Even if we have
to escape now,

164
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:15,971
we'll find some way to heal
the corrupted gems.

165
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:19,815
We can come back to Homeworld.
W-we'll still have the legs.

166
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:23,166
I don't know. I don't know
if White will ever see us.

167
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:25,117
We're almost there.

168
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:30,180
Here we are.
Hurry, get inside.

169
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,968
You're not going anywhere.

170
00:11:08,538 --> 00:11:11,239
You've made a grave mistake.

171
00:11:11,331 --> 00:11:13,317
Go to your rooms!

172
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:16,888
Uh...
Which rooms should we go to?

173
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:20,531
Blue, don't make her any
angrier than she already is.

174
00:11:20,774 --> 00:11:21,893
We're busted.

175
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:25,220
Looks like this just
turned into a face-off.

176
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:30,999
Amethyst, Pearl, Garnet?

177
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:34,210
Please... I think
we're really in trouble.

178
00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:38,320
What the heck is that?!

179
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:50,796
Yellow, Blue... did you
have a hand in this?

180
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:52,070
No way.

181
00:11:52,164 --> 00:11:54,726
White, that wasn't us!
We swear!

182
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:56,050
Then who's that?

183
00:11:56,203 --> 00:11:59,265
Who cares!
Knock her out!

184
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,585
Who's responsible
for this?

185
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:27,225
Gasp.

186
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:31,419
I always wanted to uppercut
an upper crust!

187
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:33,203
Bismuth!
Bismuth!

188
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,436
You came!

189
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,291
Heck yeah, we did.

190
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:39,437
We?
Of course.

191
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:43,580
You thought we wouldn't
be here at a time like this?

192
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,201
Lapis Lazuli
and Peridot!

193
00:12:48,838 --> 00:12:50,381
That felt great.

194
00:12:50,473 --> 00:12:52,116
Wasn't that cool, Steven?

195
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:55,811
Check out the awesome job we did
fixing up those hand ships.

196
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:00,591
Uh... who needs thumbs?

197
00:13:00,683 --> 00:13:02,656
Very cute.

198
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,671
Glad to see
we're having fun.

199
00:13:06,656 --> 00:13:10,242
However, White Diamond has
certain issues with your conduct

200
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:13,195
that will need to be addressed
before we move forward.

201
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,570
Steven, quickly... use one
of our ships to get home.

202
00:13:16,723 --> 00:13:18,039
- Huh?
- Yes.

203
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,802
You have another chance.
Take my arm.

204
00:13:20,894 --> 00:13:22,079
Fly to Earth.

205
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,806
Yellow and I will keep
White distracted.

206
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:26,664
Blue, Yellow...

207
00:13:26,843 --> 00:13:30,195
Don't worry, Steven.
We understand now.

208
00:13:30,655 --> 00:13:31,964
This way of living...

209
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,273
it must've been like
torture for you.

210
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:38,070
Just go! Hurry!
She's getting up!

211
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:41,032
No. No, I won't go.

212
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:43,258
Pink Diamond
ran away from you.

213
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,861
Rose Quartz, my mom,
she started a war with you.

214
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:48,940
But I don't want to run.

215
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:51,943
I don't want to fight.
I just want to talk.

216
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:54,836
We've come so far just to get
White Diamond's attention,

217
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:56,771
and now we finally
have it.

218
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,918
If we can fix our family,
we can fix everything!

219
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,710
But in order to fix it,

220
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:05,656
we'd have to admit
that it's broken.

221
00:14:05,748 --> 00:14:07,548
She'll never
want to hear it.

222
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,126
But it's the truth!

223
00:14:09,218 --> 00:14:11,019
My mom back on Earth
used to have

224
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:12,754
so many rules
for me to follow.

225
00:14:12,846 --> 00:14:16,701
It was so overwhelming,
and it made me feel miserable.

226
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:18,793
After I told her
how I was feeling,

227
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:20,872
things got way
better between us.

228
00:14:20,964 --> 00:14:23,598
She even let me come out
to space to help Steven.

229
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,701
If White knew how unhappy
she's made you feel,

230
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:28,646
maybe everything
would change.

231
00:14:28,738 --> 00:14:30,104
What do you say, Yellow?

232
00:14:30,196 --> 00:14:32,040
Do you think White
might actually

233
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:34,652
listen to us
for a change?

234
00:14:34,744 --> 00:14:36,077
It's worth a try.

235
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:38,947
Lend me a hand,
will you, Blue?

236
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,491
Okay.

237
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,483
- Huh?
- The ships!

238
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:53,615
Steven, take a knee.

239
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,269
Okay.

240
00:14:55,832 --> 00:14:57,683
White, please.

241
00:14:57,781 --> 00:15:01,050
All we want
you to do is listen!

242
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:02,727
That's it, Steven.

243
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:04,315
Come on, Blue.

244
00:15:14,951 --> 00:15:17,652
That's it.
Come on, everybody.

245
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:33,302
Hey, White, I know I was
in there with you for a second,

246
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:35,685
but I barely got
to talk to you at all.

247
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,306
There are so many gems
that are hurting right now.

248
00:15:38,398 --> 00:15:40,384
Even Blue and Yellow
are hurting!

249
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:42,661
You should hear
what they have to say!

250
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,896
Mmm.

251
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:46,536
This is it!

252
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:54,818
We...

253
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,552
We... we...

254
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:00,802
We need to talk!

255
00:16:01,304 --> 00:16:03,091
About us.

256
00:16:03,513 --> 00:16:06,818
I've conquered so many worlds
for the sake of the empire.

257
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:10,591
I do everything you ask,
and I do it all perfectly.

258
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:15,376
But your very high standards put
us all under a<i> lot</i> of pressure.

259
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:19,388
A Gem could crack
under so much pressure.

260
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:21,663
We Diamonds may be hard,

261
00:16:21,841 --> 00:16:24,695
but we're also brittle.

262
00:16:24,787 --> 00:16:27,098
White,
we used to be close.

263
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,589
Don't you remember?

264
00:16:28,681 --> 00:16:31,325
♪ When Pink
would make us laugh ♪

265
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:34,605
All those silly things
she did for no reason.

266
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:35,940
There<i> was</i> a reason.

267
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:38,253
She wanted us
to be happy together.

268
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:41,237
But we weren't,
and we're still not.

269
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:43,612
I know my purpose
isn't to be happy,

270
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:47,018
but I find it harder
and harder

271
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,342
to enforce your rules

272
00:16:48,434 --> 00:16:50,244
when they make me
miserable.

273
00:16:50,336 --> 00:16:53,014
When they make
us all miserable.

274
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:54,892
White, please,

275
00:16:54,984 --> 00:16:57,128
why don't you let us<i> all</i>
into your head?

276
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,687
We could come up with
a plan to help everyone.

277
00:16:59,904 --> 00:17:02,648
You could start
by helping Yellow and Blue.

278
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:08,729
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

279
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:11,299
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

280
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:15,403
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

281
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:16,571
Aaaaaaah!

282
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:23,387
What?!

283
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:24,612
Guys?!

284
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:31,162
Ah!

285
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:32,897
We gotta go!

286
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:35,423
- Whah-aah!
- Aaaaah!

287
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:38,726
Peridot, over there!

288
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:42,063
Steven!

289
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:44,899
Grab on!

290
00:17:48,048 --> 00:17:50,271
- No!
- Steven!

291
00:17:53,332 --> 00:17:54,955
Ah!

292
00:17:55,264 --> 00:17:56,464
Ah!

293
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:12,894
Amethyst!

294
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:15,385
Please reform.
I need you.

295
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:18,065
Amethyst, can you
hear me in there?

296
00:18:18,252 --> 00:18:19,610
Everyone's falling!

297
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:20,868
We can save them.

298
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,170
Together!

299
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,583
Don't worry.

300
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:27,802
I'm here for...

301
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:29,720
Uh...

302
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:31,541
What just happened?

303
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:33,614
Mmm...

304
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:35,619
Holy smokes!

305
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:37,635
I'm smoky!

306
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:40,143
Steven, you beautiful genius.

307
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:43,330
You pulled Amethyst
out of her Gem through fusion?

308
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,169
Pearl!

309
00:18:45,414 --> 00:18:48,494
Gotta throw Steven...

310
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:50,526
Don't worry about me.

311
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:53,158
"Owl" be fine.

312
00:18:57,156 --> 00:18:59,213
Come on, Pearl, dance with me.

313
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:05,680
Well, what do you know?

314
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:08,151
It's Rainbow 2.0.

315
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:11,658
Now, this is
a fine mess we're in. Huh!

316
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:14,370
That won't do.

317
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:15,899
Pbbbbbt!

318
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,700
Rainbow Quartz powers,

319
00:19:19,786 --> 00:19:20,828
activate!

320
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,893
Ah, yes.

321
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,003
Now that's two stones

322
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:30,571
with one bird.

323
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,884
Wow!

324
00:19:33,976 --> 00:19:35,276
Nice form, Pearl.

325
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:36,987
Oh, thank you.

326
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:39,651
I'm particularly excited
about the jacket.

327
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:40,791
Aah!

328
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:43,573
Steven! We fused!

329
00:19:43,986 --> 00:19:45,396
Are you guys okay?

330
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:49,338
Almost. Garnet, we're up
against a giant robot.

331
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,691
We need your help.

332
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:52,093
Please come out.

333
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:53,205
I'm here!

334
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,467

and she's never
going to let us leave.

348

If she won't listen,
we'll<i> make</i> her listen.

We'll bust into her head
and change her mind.

352
00:20:58,384 --> 00:20:59,549
Right!

353
00:20:59,673 --> 00:21:02,160
Let's take that bully down!

354
00:21:02,331 --> 00:21:03,641
But remember, kids:

00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:16,043
Kids, don't try this at home.

361
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:17,221
Ha!

362
00:21:17,313 --> 00:21:19,123
Bungakowa!

363
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:20,781
Ah! Yeah!

364
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:24,128
You can do it!

365
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,323
Believe in yourself!

366
00:21:26,424 --> 00:21:28,338
Always. do.

367
00:21:28,424 --> 00:21:29,424
Your best!

368
00:21:45,374 --> 00:21:47,097
Oh, no!

369
00:21:47,183 --> 00:21:49,316
Wah! Owwwwwww!

370
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:50,746
Oof!

371
00:21:50,832 --> 00:21:52,456
Agh! Ahh!

372
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:53,691
No dice.

373
00:21:53,783 --> 00:21:55,292
We need to be bigger.

374
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:56,550
Then let's fuse.

375
00:21:56,642 --> 00:21:57,995
All four of us.

376
00:21:58,087 --> 00:22:00,521
It's the only way we're
gonna get up to her head.

377
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:02,723
- I'm in!
- I'm in, too.

378
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:04,601
Then it's decided.

379
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,978
It's time to form Obsidian.

380
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:33,793
Huh?

381
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,543
Whoa!

382
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,909
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

383
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:58,078
They're hu-u-u-u-ge!

384
00:23:06,744 --> 00:23:08,243
Hunh!

385
00:23:11,193 --> 00:23:12,669
Uah!

386
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:14,671
Guys, we've gotta
do something

387
00:23:14,763 --> 00:23:16,464
to keep those hands
off of them.

388
00:23:16,556 --> 00:23:18,208
Right. But, first,

389
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,334
I made you
a little somethin'.

390
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:21,800
My own sword?

391
00:23:21,918 --> 00:23:23,580
It's perfect!

392
00:23:23,672 --> 00:23:25,673
Let's show White Diamond

393
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,074
we mean Bismuth.

394
00:23:28,935 --> 00:23:30,652
Grab on.

395
00:23:32,548 --> 00:23:35,349
Time to take
this thing apart!

396
00:23:37,553 --> 00:23:39,824
Set your eyes on me,
Homeworld!

397
00:23:39,963 --> 00:23:43,121
I, Peridot, have returned,
not as your servant,

398
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:45,261
but as your savior!

399
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:47,504
I rule the skies!

400
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:53,133
Roh! Wh-wh-whoa!

401
00:24:12,354 --> 00:24:13,871
Try and catch me,

402
00:24:13,957 --> 00:24:17,175
you enlarged,
bipedal housing unit!

403
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:18,999
Whoa! Ah!

404
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:21,269
Lapis! Bismuth!

405
00:24:21,787 --> 00:24:23,441
Ahhgh!

406
00:24:23,877 --> 00:24:25,121
Aah-aah-aah!

407
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:27,034
Hold on! I've got ya!

408
00:24:27,126 --> 00:24:30,371
Whoa-whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!

409
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:34,508
Whoa-whoa-oa-oa!

410
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,888
Ooh.

411
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,174
Oof!

412
00:24:37,872 --> 00:24:39,623
Ah.

413
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:40,747
Aah!

414
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,271
Whoa-ah!

415
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:43,724
Aaaaah!

416
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:47,216
Ah. Ohh. Uhhhhh.

417
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:49,597
Whoa-oa-oa-aah-aah-aah!

418
00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:51,134
Ah!

419
00:24:51,732 --> 00:24:54,200
Ah! Thanks.

420
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:59,208
Heads up! I've got this!

421
00:25:11,614 --> 00:25:13,583
Ahh-aah!

422
00:25:14,193 --> 00:25:16,250
I'll let you take this one.

423
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:50,497
Anh!

424
00:25:50,586 --> 00:25:52,262
Guys! Connie!

425
00:25:52,348 --> 00:25:53,310
Keep going!

426
00:25:53,396 --> 00:25:55,380
I'm right behind you!

427
00:25:56,207 --> 00:25:57,239
There!

428
00:25:57,325 --> 00:25:59,044
We can get inside
through the eye.

429
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,130
Come on!

430
00:26:04,003 --> 00:26:05,255
Hurry!

431
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,270
Whoa-ah!

432
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,958
Huh!

433
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,817
White Diamond.

434
00:26:30,177 --> 00:26:32,593
Oh, Starlight,
what are you doing,

435
00:26:32,685 --> 00:26:33,961
crawling in here?

436
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:35,872
You want your legs back?

437
00:26:36,016 --> 00:26:37,567
You want
your planet back?

438
00:26:37,794 --> 00:26:40,716
Surely, you can understand
why I can't let you leave.

439
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:43,947
Look what you did
to yourself last time.

440
00:26:44,177 --> 00:26:47,192
White Diamond, my name
is Steven Universe.

441
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:48,372
I'm here to...

442
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:49,458
Aah!

443
00:26:49,544 --> 00:26:50,820
My, my.

444
00:26:51,046 --> 00:26:54,435
We've been causing
quite a scene, haven't we?

445
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:57,317
What have you done
to them?! They're...

446
00:26:57,403 --> 00:27:01,014
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

447
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,036
Poor Yellow.

448
00:27:03,231 --> 00:27:06,466
Her impurities absorb
all the blue in her light.

449
00:27:06,652 --> 00:27:08,317
She's so strong...

450
00:27:08,442 --> 00:27:11,031
but so weak,
when it comes to Blue.

451
00:27:11,216 --> 00:27:12,794
Ah, and Blue...

452
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,279
Her impurities soak up all
of the warmth in her spectrum.

453
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:18,419
She thinks she needs you, Pink.

454
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:21,652
As for me, I'm certain
I don't<i> need</i> you.

455
00:27:21,888 --> 00:27:24,311
After all, I'm every
color of the light.

456
00:27:24,418 --> 00:27:26,255
But you're a part of me.

457
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,145
The part I always
have to repress.

458
00:27:29,411 --> 00:27:30,527
What?!

459
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:33,294
Dude, what is she
even talking about?

460
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:34,688
This is nonsense!

461
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,167
Oh. Hello there.

462
00:27:37,286 --> 00:27:39,528
Your new friends are so funny.

463
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:42,435
Is that what they're
supposed to be, funny?

464
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,693
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

465
00:27:49,905 --> 00:27:51,872
Hey, White dirtwad!

466
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:54,130
That all you got?!

467
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:55,505
Huh?

468
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:58,395
Oh, no!

469
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:01,692
Leave her alone!

470
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,965
Aggggggh!

471
00:28:05,888 --> 00:28:09,723
Arrrrrrrggggggghhhhhhh!

472
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:11,450
Stop!

473
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,611
Ah! Ahh!

474
00:28:14,697 --> 00:28:16,764
Ahh ahh ahhhh!

475
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:19,176
Ahhhhh!

476
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:22,225
It's a pity, the way
you bring out the worst in others.

477
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,805
See how you've encouraged
their deficiencies?

478
00:28:24,897 --> 00:28:27,608
It's written<i> all</i>
over their Gems:

479
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,076
insecure,

480
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:31,021
dependent,

481
00:28:31,152 --> 00:28:33,201
obsessed.

482
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:35,249
Oh, no, no.

483
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:36,426
Guys!

484
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:38,152
Come on,
snap out of it!

485
00:28:38,244 --> 00:28:40,230
Please stop<i> helping</i> them.

486
00:28:40,322 --> 00:28:42,122
You'll only make things worse.

487
00:28:42,214 --> 00:28:43,757
That's what you do.

488
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:45,726
<i>I</i> make things better.

489
00:28:45,818 --> 00:28:48,105
Here...

490
00:28:48,197 --> 00:28:50,073
Oh, thank you,
White Diamond.

491
00:28:50,165 --> 00:28:51,733
I feel excellent now.

492
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:57,319
Oh, thank you.
How generous of you.

493
00:28:57,405 --> 00:29:00,248
Thank you, White Diamond.
We feel so much better now.

494
00:29:00,334 --> 00:29:02,419
I feel excellent.

495
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:04,014
There we are!

496
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,561
I've removed their flaws.

497
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:07,826
Now, there is nothing
to hinder my white light

498
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,412
from sparkling through them.

499
00:29:09,506 --> 00:29:12,209
I'd rather not spread
my uninhibited self so thin,

500
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:14,670
you know, but you've made it
absolutely necessary.

501
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:17,964
Now, the impurities you've
encouraged in them are gone.

502
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,960
Now, they are brilliant!

503
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:22,429
Now, they are perfect!
Now...

504
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:24,655
they are me!

505
00:29:25,234 --> 00:29:26,787
You're wrong.

506
00:29:27,502 --> 00:29:29,959
Please,
just listen to me!

507
00:29:30,505 --> 00:29:32,639
My friends don't need
to be fixed!

508
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:35,619
They're fine the way they
are, flaws and all!

509
00:29:35,711 --> 00:29:37,005
There you go again.

510
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:40,113
Do you understand
why you defend their flaws?

511
00:29:40,205 --> 00:29:41,725
I know why, Pink.

512
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,593
You<i> like</i> surrounding yourself
with inferior Gems.

513
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:46,687
What?!

514
00:29:46,773 --> 00:29:48,789
You enable
their terrible behavior,

515
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:51,658
so<i> you</i> can be
the best of the worst.

516
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,170
That's not true!

517
00:29:53,262 --> 00:29:54,862
And, even if it is...

518
00:29:54,954 --> 00:29:56,072
Even if it was,

519
00:29:56,187 --> 00:29:57,687
y-you're talking
about my mom.

520
00:29:57,773 --> 00:29:59,578
You're not talking
about me!

521
00:30:02,221 --> 00:30:04,500
Your "mom"?

522
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:14,367
Guys, I'm here!

523
00:30:14,453 --> 00:30:16,296
Huh?

524
00:30:16,554 --> 00:30:17,828
Pearl?

525
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,962
Connie!

526
00:30:19,054 --> 00:30:20,487
Well, what have we here?

527
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:23,070
It's another one of your pets.

528
00:30:27,062 --> 00:30:28,890
Wait! Whoa!

529
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:31,565
Huh?

530
00:30:31,657 --> 00:30:32,929
Aah!

531
00:30:39,908 --> 00:30:41,284
Let her go.

532
00:30:41,376 --> 00:30:43,844
These worthless Gems
weren't enough, were they?

533
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:47,123
See how you surround yourself
with lower life forms?

534
00:30:47,215 --> 00:30:49,216
You've smothered
yourself in them.

535
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:51,685
It feels good, doesn't it, Pink?

536
00:30:51,777 --> 00:30:54,631
Dulling your power,
hiding your face,

537
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:57,391
blaming<i> everything</i>
on someone else.

538
00:30:57,483 --> 00:30:59,852
You became Rose Quartz

539
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:01,337
to deceive
your pathetic friends.

540
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,263
And, now,
you've improved on that,

541
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:06,300
because you're even
deceiving yourself.

542
00:31:06,392 --> 00:31:08,302
No. You're wrong!

543
00:31:08,394 --> 00:31:10,213
I'm not my mom!

544
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:11,445
But don't you know things
about her

545
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,185
that you couldn't possibly know?

546
00:31:15,277 --> 00:31:18,852
I-I've just been
connecting with her.

547
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:21,360
My powers, they...

548
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:23,376
They help me
connect to others.

549
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:31,301
I-I'm not her.

550
00:31:31,387 --> 00:31:32,433
I'm just...

551
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,094
feeling her feelings.

552
00:31:40,035 --> 00:31:41,578
Isn't it obvious?

553
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,237
Even though you've embedded
yourself in that human child,

554
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:47,183
your light can't help
shining through.

555
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:48,919
You know you're in there.

556
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:50,577
You've known it all along.

557
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:52,624
Stop cowering inside your Gem.

558
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:54,281
You can hide from yourself,

559
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:56,811
but you can't hide
from me, Pink.

560
00:31:57,986 --> 00:31:59,351
Don't listen to her,
Steven!

561
00:31:59,437 --> 00:32:01,850
She's just trying
to mess with you!

562
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,827
Steven!

563
00:32:16,805 --> 00:32:18,086
Now, Starlight,

564
00:32:18,226 --> 00:32:20,563
this has gone on long enough.

565
00:32:26,982 --> 00:32:29,016
It's time to come out,

566
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:30,457
Pink.

567
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,546
No-o-o-o-o!

568
00:32:42,576 --> 00:32:43,976
Steven.

569
00:32:44,446 --> 00:32:45,999
Steven, please.

570
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:48,227
Steven, wake up.

571
00:32:48,338 --> 00:32:50,072
Look at me! Please.

572
00:32:50,212 --> 00:32:51,547
Steven?

573
00:32:52,374 --> 00:32:53,540
Steven!

574
00:32:55,297 --> 00:32:56,987
What?

575
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,339
No. Where?

576
00:32:58,484 --> 00:33:00,987
Where... Where's my...?

577
00:33:39,612 --> 00:33:41,034
Anh!

578
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,530
Steven!

579
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,235
No.

580
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:46,526
Please, I...

581
00:33:46,618 --> 00:33:48,635
I need... I need...

582
00:33:48,783 --> 00:33:51,237
What is this?
Where is Pink?

583
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,976
<i>She's gone.</i>

584
00:33:53,068 --> 00:33:54,868
What did you say?

585
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,909
Answer me!

586
00:33:56,995 --> 00:34:02,342
<i>She's go-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne!</i>

587
00:34:16,158 --> 00:34:17,958
Where do you think
you're going?

588
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,535
Help.

589
00:34:23,621 --> 00:34:24,986
Steven!

590
00:34:26,268 --> 00:34:27,801
Hold on!

591
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:33,746
Don't you dare take
one more step!

592
00:34:33,832 --> 00:34:36,119
One more step!

593
00:34:36,211 --> 00:34:37,744
That's enough!

594
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:46,753
Ahhh, you little...

595
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:55,268
Agh! Don't you raise
your shield at me!

596
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:58,041
I only want you
to be yourself!

597
00:34:58,133 --> 00:34:59,833
If you can't do that,

598
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:01,101
I'll do it

599
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:03,451
for! you!

600
00:35:14,482 --> 00:35:16,358
Aaaah!

601
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:19,262
No, stop.

602
00:35:19,354 --> 00:35:20,387
You're hurting them!

603
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:21,855
Ahh!

604
00:35:21,947 --> 00:35:23,490
Ahh!

605
00:35:31,703 --> 00:35:33,124
Here.

606
00:35:42,545 --> 00:35:43,743
What are you doing?

607
00:35:43,952 --> 00:35:46,624
Pink!
Why are you laughing?

608
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:06,032
Steven!

609
00:36:06,452 --> 00:36:07,810
Oh!

610
00:36:08,147 --> 00:36:11,271
Are you back together?
Are you you?

611
00:36:11,363 --> 00:36:13,827
Yeah! Yeah, I'm me!

612
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:15,342
I've always been me...

613
00:36:15,434 --> 00:36:17,987
No! You are Pink Diamond!

614
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,457
That is Pink Diamond's gem!
You do not look like this!

615
00:36:21,549 --> 00:36:22,882
You do not sound like this!

616
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:25,217
You are not half human,
you're just...

617
00:36:25,342 --> 00:36:27,897
acting like a child!

618
00:36:28,347 --> 00:36:30,085
I am a child.

619
00:36:30,258 --> 00:36:32,092
What's<i> your</i> excuse?

620
00:36:45,573 --> 00:36:46,858
What's happening?

621
00:36:46,952 --> 00:36:48,017
What is this?

622
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:49,542
What's wrong with them?

623
00:36:49,634 --> 00:36:51,913
They're turning pink!

624
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,747
I don't understand...

625
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,202
<i>I'm</i> in control, I...

626
00:36:57,352 --> 00:36:58,637
Something's wrong...

627
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:00,129
with me!

628
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:01,928
No!

629
00:37:08,463 --> 00:37:09,896
- Guys!
- Guys!

630
00:37:09,988 --> 00:37:14,051
Steven...
Are you okay?!

631
00:37:14,295 --> 00:37:16,472
Uh, what happened?

632
00:37:16,705 --> 00:37:18,905
I think Steven got
through to her!

633
00:37:18,997 --> 00:37:19,942
Aah!

634
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:22,082
- Aah!
- Ha!

635
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,583
Listen up, you nail heads!

636
00:37:24,669 --> 00:37:27,480
The Crystal Gems
are here to... huh?

637
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:31,473
Steven!

638
00:37:32,307 --> 00:37:34,582
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

639
00:37:34,656 --> 00:37:35,922
Oh, look at White.

640
00:37:36,014 --> 00:37:38,591
She's shakin' like
a piece of chalk!

641
00:37:38,683 --> 00:37:41,982
Wh-What happened...

642
00:37:42,156 --> 00:37:43,732
Where am I?

643
00:37:43,818 --> 00:37:45,118
Welcome back.

644
00:37:45,302 --> 00:37:46,645
What is this?!

645
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,642
I feel... ridiculous.

646
00:37:49,763 --> 00:37:51,639
Yellow, Blue!

647
00:37:52,045 --> 00:37:55,809
She's off-color.

648
00:37:58,813 --> 00:38:00,347
This can't be happening!

649
00:38:00,439 --> 00:38:03,983
I can't have a flaw!
I'm supposed to be flawless!

650
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:07,120
If I'm not perfect,
then... who am I?!

651
00:38:07,212 --> 00:38:10,523
If you're not Pink,
then... who are you?!

652
00:38:10,615 --> 00:38:12,735
Who... Who is anyone?!

653
00:38:12,827 --> 00:38:16,773
Ya know, if you just let
everyone be whoever they are,

654
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:20,076
maybe you could let yourself
be whoever you are, too.

655
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:22,135
But I'm not supposed
to be like this!

656
00:38:22,227 --> 00:38:25,739
I'm supposed to know better!
I'm supposed to<i> be</i> better!

657
00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:29,576
I'm supposed to make
everything better!

658
00:38:29,668 --> 00:38:30,953
You can!

659
00:38:31,045 --> 00:38:34,147

have to leave your own head.

I predict our long journey

678

Lars: Welcome home, guys.

679
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:53,403
We finally made it!
Earth!

680

we're cracked.

Aah! It's the Diamonds!

Hey there, buddy.

692

Whoa!

Lars?
It's really you!

694
00:40:34,526 --> 00:40:36,312
Sadie?!

Sadie... in person!

697
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,476
Hey.

698
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:45,715
Lars isn't going
to know what to say!

699
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,287
Shh!
Give 'em a moment!

700
00:40:48,373 --> 00:40:51,260
Lars... look at you!

701
00:40:51,352 --> 00:40:53,809
