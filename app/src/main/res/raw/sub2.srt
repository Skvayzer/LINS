00:00:06,824 --> 00:00:08,557
Hello?

3
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:11,560
Must be Pink's room?

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:16,132
I need a bed.
What?!

5
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:18,400
<i>Go, go, go! Go!</i>

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,836
Well, I need a place to sit!

7
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:26,976
<i>Oh! Oh, oh!</i>

8
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:29,712
Hmm.

9
00:00:29,747 --> 00:00:34,717
I need a shelf for my face,
face, face, face, face.

10
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:36,352
Eh.

11
00:00:36,353 --> 00:00:38,621
Hey! Who the heck are
you little guys?

12
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,758
Thank you!

13
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,760
"Thank you"?

14
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:48,063
- Is it...
- It is her!

15
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:52,568
- Why does she look different?
- She's back!

16
00:00:52,603 --> 00:00:56,438
It's time! It's time!
Oh, Diamond ... Pink, Pink!

17
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,874
Aagh!

18
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,943
Don't ... don't build
stuff in my mouth.

19
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:05,147
All right, who are you guys?

20
00:01:05,182 --> 00:01:09,652
- Very funny, Pink!
- Always playing her games.

21
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:12,622
Pretending she doesn't
know us pebbles.

22
00:01:17,528 --> 00:01:18,828
- Pearl!
- Steven!

23
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:22,197
Oh, thank the stars!
You're okay!

24
00:01:22,232 --> 00:01:24,833
What did White Diamond do?
Did she hurt you?!

25
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:27,202
No, she was like,
"Welcome home."

26
00:01:27,237 --> 00:01:30,005
I don't think she understands
that I'm not Pink Diamond.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,474
Where's Connie?
And Garnet and Amethyst?

28
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,077
They're still on the ship.

29
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:36,845
I'm only here because
I'm bringing your things.

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,314
And they consider me
one of your things.

31
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,017
Yeesh.

32
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:45,621
The Diamond chime ...
it's Yellow!

33
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:49,324
Pink Diamond, my Diamond
has requested your presence

34
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,493
in the extraction chamber.

35
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,163
Let's get you into a suit.

36
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:57,633
Swim trunks don't
seem very formal.

37
00:01:57,668 --> 00:02:01,136
Trust me, this will be
more comfortable than jeans.

38
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,243
Hello!

39
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:16,351
- Pink Diamond.
- Please, call me Steven.

40
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,988
- Pink Steven.
- No, just Steven.

41
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:22,524
Just Steven.

42
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,128
Call me...
lasagna.

43
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:28,030
Steven, stop, you're
going to break her.

44
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,066
Have a nice extraction,
Pink Lasagna.

45
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:38,340
- Pink.
- Hi, Yellow. Cool sauna.

46
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,576
It's new.
Have a seat.

47
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:45,414
Oop!

48
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,883
So, you met with White.
How was it?

49
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:51,887
All I got to say was,
"Hi," and, "um," and, "I."

50
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:55,257
Two and a half words ...
that's a record.

51
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:56,893
Two and a half words
isn't enough.

52
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:59,278
I still need to talk to White
about healing

53
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,098
- all the corrupted gems!
- Hmm. Good luck.

54
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,600
White never leaves
her own head these days,

55
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:08,437
and she never lets anyone in ...
except you, I guess.

56
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:09,939
It's so unfair.

57
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,108
I have hundreds of successful
crystal system colonies,

58
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:16,612
but you get to see her because
your one colony is a failure!

59
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:19,515
Maybe you should just...
fail?

60
00:03:24,922 --> 00:03:27,589
Oh, Pink, you always
did have quite a knack

61
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:31,093
for making me laugh.
You're almost worth the trouble.

62
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,095
Ugh.

63
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,099
Already?
Excuse me.

64
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:49,244
I've got to check on the latest
Citrine production reports.

65
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,814
What should I do about White?
I still need to talk to her

66
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,783
about helping the corrupted gems.

67
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:59,755
Pink Diamond, my Diamond
has requested your presence.

68
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,924
We barely talked about White at all.

69
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,693
She had to rush to do a report,
and I couldn't go with her.

70
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:06,229
I get they're, like, busy,

71
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,830
'cause they're dictators
and everything

72
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,132
but I need more time!

73
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,134
I should have asked her
what she was doing

74
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,571
- after the Citron thing!
- She'll be at that for a while.

75
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:18,540
Yellow Diamond oversees
all aspects of gem production

76
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:20,475
on every single one
of her colonies.

77
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,345
And when she's not doing that,
she's off with her army,

78
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,014
conquering the next one.

79
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,482
What about their days off,
weekends?

80
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,653
My Diamond is
awaiting our arrival.

81
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,999
Blue Diamond is
just up the stairs.

82
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:47,302
- I'll wait for you here.
- I'll be back in a bit!

83
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:49,037
Welcome back.

Okay.

88
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,226
Whoo-hoo!

89
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,929
It's funny. I ... I live
right next to the ocean,

90
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:16,098
but I end up going
to space to swim.

91
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,771
You haven't changed.

92
00:05:21,772 --> 00:05:24,773
So silly. So small.

93
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:26,242
I'm not done growing.

94
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,877
I'm not sure I can catch up
to you and Yellow, though.

95
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,180
I'm so glad you're back...
Steven.

96
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:36,096
- Y-you actually said my name!
- Steven.

97
00:05:36,097 --> 00:05:38,854
Steee-von.

98
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:41,056
It's such a funny sounding name.

99
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,925
You're so creative, Pink!

100
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,126
Remember when
I let you name

101
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:47,529
that batch of pyrite
"fool's gold"?

102
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:51,099
White was furious!

103
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:53,135
I'm sorry.
I don't remember.

104
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,672
Oh. Do you remember the game
we used to play here?

105
00:05:57,975 --> 00:06:00,142
We had such fun together ...

106
00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:04,579
you and I and Yellow
and White.

107
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,581
We were all together here?!

108
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,017
You would stand under water,

109
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:10,285
all the way at the bottom,
and sing.

110
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,921
And we would be
above the surface

111
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:13,655
trying to guess the song.

112
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,191
Can we do that
right now?

113
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:16,759
Maybe after, we can talk White

114
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,327
into coming back to Earth with us.

115
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:22,264
No. We stopped coming here
together after you left.

116
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,399
That was the start of Era 2.

117
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:28,837
No one wanted to be here ...
not with your empty spot.

118
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:31,640
It was so quiet.

119
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:33,976
I know you guys have
colony stuff to do,

120
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,111
but we should spend
more time together.

121
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:43,785
My apologies, my Diamond,
but your next appointment.

122
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,221
- Of course.
- Wait!

123
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:47,255
I wanted to talk
to you about White.

124
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,294
- Later, perhaps.
- Aah!

125
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,997
- Pearl?
- Steven?

126
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,901
- Some water got up my nose.
- Oh, dear.

127
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:02,004
This is so weird.

128
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,439
Was this some sort of
spa day or something?

129
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:06,875
And what about Pink?
Did she have a job here,

130
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,177
or did she just
sit in her room

131
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,112
while they were off
doing whatever?

132
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:13,648
Before her colony, Pink used
to throw massive balls.

133
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,517
She was a juggler?!

134
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:17,986
No ... Well, yes.

135
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,689
But she would also throw parties
for the other Diamonds,

136
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:22,557
to mark their
many accomplishments.

137
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:25,394
Every member of every court
would show up to bask

138
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:28,630
in the presence
of all four Diamonds.

139
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:29,832
Even White would come?

140
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,333
Oh, yes!

141
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:34,403
Huh. I wonder what's even
become of Pink's court.

142
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:37,572
That reminds me.
Hang tight. I'll be back.

143
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:40,675
Where would I
even...go?

144
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,678
What did I get myself into?

145
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:55,157
Am I just supposed to
be Pink Diamond now?

146
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:57,926
Hey, pebbles, can you help me?

147
00:07:57,961 --> 00:08:00,162
Who was she?
What did she do?

148
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:03,031
And why does this feel so...

149
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,600

and I couldn't come
along on adventures?

You guys would still drop
everything to hang out with me!
