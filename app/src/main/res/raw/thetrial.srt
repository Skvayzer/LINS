2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:06,028
I know my mom
did something really bad.

3
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:09,434
Whatever Homeworld
has in store for me...

4
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:13,337
I'm ready!

5
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:16,211
I said, I'm ready!

6
00:00:16,241 --> 00:00:18,541
It's me ... Rose Quartz!

7
00:00:18,576 --> 00:00:21,382
Hello?
Anybody?

8
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:24,253
Lars, are you there?

9
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:26,052
Is this the punishment?

10
00:00:26,084 --> 00:00:27,524
Come on!

11
00:00:27,552 --> 00:00:29,452
I know it's going to be
worse than this!

12
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,287
So whatever you're gonna do...

13
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,623
would you just do it already?

14
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,558
This is ridiculous!

15
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:37,793
4,000 years of loyal
service to the court,

16
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,129
and this is what I get?

17
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,734
Oh, I'm the unluckiest Zircon
in the galaxy!

18
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:44,696
Wait, are you...

19
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:48,705
- Rose Quartz?
- Yeah.

20
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,644
- Really?
- It's a long story.

21
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,474
Then I don't have time for it.
Ugh!

22
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:56,414
We only have this brief
moment to prepare your case.

23
00:00:56,448 --> 00:00:59,119
- Case?
- Ugh! Who am I kidding?!

24
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,250
This is pointless!

25
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:02,245
We've all heard the rumors
about the demise

26
00:01:02,287 --> 00:01:04,917
of Pink Diamond,
but I can't believe these files!

27
00:01:04,956 --> 00:01:07,616
Shattered by one
of her own soldiers ... ha!

28
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:10,089
In front of her entire entourage!

29
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:11,258
And look at you now!

30
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:13,326
That ridiculous disguise
is only going to make you

31
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:16,472
- look more guilty!
- That's fine, because I am!

32
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:18,101
Well, don't say that ...

33
00:01:18,136 --> 00:01:19,936
especially not when
you're out there!

34
00:01:19,971 --> 00:01:22,171
Out where?!
What's going to happen!?

35
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,737
What did you think was
going to happen, Rose Quartz?!

36
00:01:25,777 --> 00:01:30,441
As soon as that door opens,
you're going on trial!

37
00:01:31,016 --> 00:01:32,176
Oh.

38
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:44,978
Defending a rebel?
Isn't that ... treason?

39
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:49,144
I was assigned to this!

40
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:54,112
All rise for the luminous
Yellow Diamond!

41
00:01:54,152 --> 00:01:57,582
And the lustrous Blue Diamond.

42
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:09,641
Where is the accused?

43
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:12,468
Is that Rose Quartz?

44
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:14,764
Look at this hideous form
she's taken.

45
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:16,136
Forget the trial.

46
00:02:16,174 --> 00:02:19,104
We should shatter her
just for looking like that.

47
00:02:19,144 --> 00:02:22,344
No! I want to hear her
make her case.

48
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:25,851
I want to know what she thinks
we're going to do with her,

49
00:02:25,884 --> 00:02:29,614
because I want to
do something worse.

50
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,659
Fine! Let's just get on
with it, shall we?

51
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:39,380
My Diamond.

52
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:43,033
My brilliant, opulent,
radiant, glimmering ...

53
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:46,808
"My Diamond" will suffice,
or we'll never get through this.

54
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:49,338
Of course, My Diamond.

55
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:53,974
Rose Quartz committed
a crime so unprecedented

56
00:02:54,012 --> 00:02:57,212
that one can't help
but wonder ... why?

57
00:02:57,249 --> 00:02:58,849
Exhibit "A."

58
00:03:00,252 --> 00:03:03,319
- Lars!
- Steven! What's going on here?!

59
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:04,685
Where are we?!

60
00:03:04,723 --> 00:03:07,123
<i>Who are those huge, giant ladies?!</i>

61
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,499
As we can see from this specimen...

62
00:03:09,528 --> 00:03:12,568
...humans are loud,
absolutely hideous creatures

63
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:14,197
that serve no purpose whatsoever.

64
00:03:14,232 --> 00:03:17,062
What sort of Gem would turn on
her own kind for this?

65
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:20,202
I'll tell you what kind ...
that kind.

66
00:03:20,238 --> 00:03:23,338
Just let him go! He's got
nothing to do with this!

67
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,905
There it is ...
the passion, the fury ...

68
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:30,745
that caused the diabolical
Rose Quartz to...

69
00:03:30,782 --> 00:03:33,642
shatter her own diamond!

70
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:37,357
But I know what
you're thinking...

71
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:39,859
"This thing doesn't look like
a Rose Quartz."

72
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:43,701
And for that, I would like
to call an eyewitness!

73
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:49,833
Oh, Eyeball!

74
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:53,068
Do not address me,
war criminal!

75
00:03:53,105 --> 00:03:55,375
I'm just glad you're okay.

76
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:58,777
I heard it straight from her.
She said...

77
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,880
"I'm the mighty Rose Quartz.

78
00:04:00,912 --> 00:04:04,212
I've got her shield
and everything."

79
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:08,219
And then she threw me
into space!

80
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:11,413
I tried to help you!
I healed your Gem!

81
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:13,226
And who else has the ability

82
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:16,728
to heal Gems other than
the villainous...

83
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:19,301
Rose Quartz?!

84
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:20,531
And there you have it!

85
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:22,895
Rose Quartz did it,
and that's Rose Quartz.

86
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:24,594
I rest my case.

87
00:04:24,636 --> 00:04:26,766
Oh, she's good.

88
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:32,074
Well, I'm convinced!
Time to execute!

89
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,980
Not yet. The defense
still has to speak.

90
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:37,314
Right! Well, uh...

91
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:40,889
Before I start, my very,
uh, thought-out defense,

92
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,389
I'd like to remind the court

93
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,590
that Rose Quartz
did turn herself in.

94
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:48,753
The Court remembers,
and the Court does not care.

95
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:52,093
Uh, of course.
Uh, in ... innocent!

96
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,800
Uh, the word "innocent"
can mean,

97
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,895
- oh, many different things.
- I did it!

98
00:04:57,936 --> 00:04:59,666
Wha... What, what!
Stop!

99
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:04,339
No! I want to hear
what she has to say.

100
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,819
<i>Get us out of here, Steven!</i>

101
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:12,945
Uh...

102
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:15,584
State your name for
the record, please!

103
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,190
I, um...

104
00:05:17,222 --> 00:05:20,982
I am Rose Quartz...
and I'm guilty.

105
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:25,265
Wait! No, don't say that!

106
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:28,127
Everything you guys
said I did, I did.

107
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,996
And I did it by myself.
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:33,436
I'll accept any punishment
you want to give me.

109
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:35,706
Just let him go!

110
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:37,941
And leave the Earth alone.

111
00:05:37,976 --> 00:05:41,106
Ha! Sounds like
a solid confession to me!

112
00:05:41,146 --> 00:05:44,476
How?
How did you do it?

113
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:45,446
Huh?

114
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:49,613
How did you shatter
Pink Diamond?

115
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:51,454
Um, well...

116
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:55,159
I did it on Earth in front
of Pink Diamond's palanquin.

117
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:59,992
I was probably like "Stop!"
And she was all like, "No!"

118
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:02,401
So we fought ... I think.

119
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:05,464
And she probably did
some cool moves.

120
00:06:05,503 --> 00:06:07,503
I probably did
some cool stuff, too,

121
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:10,492
some jump kicks and stuff.
But I was most likely

122
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:13,810
deeply conflicted
about deciding to shatter her.

123
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:15,515
Definitely crying.

124
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:18,717
I probably had to use
the Breaking Point to do it.

125
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,550
It was a sword!

126
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:31,898
You ... shattered her...
with a sword!

127
00:06:33,265 --> 00:06:35,765
That's quite enough
testimony from you!

128
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,000
We shall take
a short recess.

129
00:06:38,036 --> 00:06:39,906
What are you saying in there?!

130
00:06:39,938 --> 00:06:41,868
"Maybe" this,
"probably" that!

131
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:43,736
Oh, what do you mean
probably?!

132
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:45,175
Look, I just...

133
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,050
I don't actually know
how it happened, okay?

134
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,719
You don't know?!

135
00:06:49,748 --> 00:06:52,882
- I...
- Don't tumble my rocks!

136
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:54,917
Both our Gems are on the line!

137
00:06:54,953 --> 00:06:59,391
- Did you do this or not?!
- It was me, all right!

138
00:06:59,424 --> 00:07:01,554
Rose Quartz did it,
and I've got her Gem,

139
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:04,123
so I'm the one
who's gotta pay for this!

140
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:07,492
You don't know how
it happened.

141
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:10,617
I get it.
There's a reason

142
00:07:10,618 --> 00:07:13,434
they want you to explain
how you did it.

143
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:14,411
Huh?

144
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,152
It's because it
doesn't make sense!

145
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:22,474
Rose Quartz is flawed,
I grant you.

146
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:25,984
A shallow strata Gem
who turned on her own kind

147
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:28,917
out of a misguided
attachment to a planet

148
00:07:28,953 --> 00:07:30,483
and creatures like these.

149
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:31,912
<i>What?! Huh?!</i>

150
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:35,796
It's indisputable that as
the diamond overseeing Earth,

151
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:38,257
Pink was Rose Quartz's enemy.

152
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:41,396
Rose had everything to gain
by shattering her.

153
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,933
But even though she may
have wanted to shatter

154
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:46,368
Pink Diamond, could she?

155
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:50,072
Blue Diamond, for the purpose
of this argument,

156
00:07:50,108 --> 00:07:52,248
may I present
your palanquin?

157
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:54,247
Is this necessary?

158
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,179
Isn't it?
Please, proceed.

159
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:02,635
Now, as the records show,
Pink Diamond was shattered

160
00:08:02,636 --> 00:08:06,483
just outside a palanquin
much like this.

161
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:09,294
Witnesses said,
Pink had stepped out

162
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:11,997
and had taken only
a few steps forward,

163
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,870
when Rose attacked her
from the front.

164
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:15,298
Oh!

165
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,533
The question no one seems
to be asking is "how?"

166
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,140
I've been asking
that question.

167
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:24,532
A-a-a-and right you are to ask,
My Diamond!

168
00:08:24,576 --> 00:08:27,176
B-because, at the time
that Pink was shattered,

169
00:08:27,212 --> 00:08:29,312
Rose Quartz had been
a recognized threat

170
00:08:29,347 --> 00:08:31,177
for several hundred years.

171
00:08:31,216 --> 00:08:34,686
There were no Rose Quartz
soldiers in her entourage,

172
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,659
and none in her guard.

173
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:38,728
So how did a Rose Quartz,

174
00:08:38,757 --> 00:08:42,957
with no business being
anywhere near Pink Diamond,

175
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:45,324
get so close in the first place?

176
00:08:45,363 --> 00:08:47,863
Where were Pink Diamond's
attendants?

177
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:50,669
Her Agates, her Sapphires?

178
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:54,632
And where was her Pearl?

179
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:56,232
They were with her,
of course.

180
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:57,704
They saw the whole thing!

181
00:08:57,742 --> 00:09:00,542
But none of them saw
Rose Quartz approach?

182
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:03,518
Wouldn't her Sapphires
have seen Rose Quartz coming?

183
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:06,588
Wouldn't her Agates
have tried to fight her off?

184
00:09:06,618 --> 00:09:08,148
<i>That is strange!</i>

185
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:10,586
She must have slipped past them!

186
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:11,852
Even if she did,

187
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,930
wouldn't her Pearl have
cried out in alarm,

188
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,929
"Watch out, my Diamond!"

189
00:09:18,963 --> 00:09:23,393
No, whoever did this was
already close to Pink Diamond,

190
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:26,365
someone her guards
would allow to get near her,

191
00:09:26,404 --> 00:09:28,734
someone she would listen to

192
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:30,903
when asked to stop her palanquin

193
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:32,542
and step outside,

194
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:37,177
and someone with the authority
to cover it up afterwards!

195
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:39,245
Someone with supreme authority!

196
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:43,054
Someone ... like one of you!

197
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:49,012
Uh, disregard that last statement!

198
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,750
I might have gotten carried away.

199
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,683
Case closed, right, My Diamond?

200
00:09:57,726 --> 00:09:59,766
Yellow, stop it!
Why are you doing this?!

201
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:01,495
This is our chance!
We gotta go!

202
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,445
- Where?!
- We don't need

203
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:04,438
- to listen to this nonsense!
- There!

204
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:06,506
Let's shatter Rose Quartz
and be done with it!

205
00:10:06,535 --> 00:10:09,535
Can't you restrain yourself?!

206
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:12,846
- But this is pointless!
- No, it's not!

207
00:10:12,874 --> 00:10:14,374
Hurry up
and drive this thing!

208
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:17,569
Those giant crazy chicks aren't
gonna be distracted forever!

209
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:30,889
Where is this?

210
00:10:30,926 --> 00:10:32,709
Homeworld.

211
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:38,965
You think
you can get away, Rose?

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,730
You stood your ground on that
little speck called Earth ...

213
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:45,601
but you're on our world now.

214
00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:52,814
