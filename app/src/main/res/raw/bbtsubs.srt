1
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:04,287
Okay, Babydoll Pink, let's see
if you can cover up the fact

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,438
that I got my dad's feet.

3
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,507
It's just two degrees, Sheldon.

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,908
I just want to turn up the
thermostat two degrees!

5
00:00:11,082 --> 00:00:14,185
Let me point out that two
degrees can be the difference

6
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:16,220
between water and steam.

7
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:18,455
Yes, if we lived in a teakettle.

8
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:20,157
This is the temperature
you agreed to

9
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:21,525
in the roommate agreement.

10
00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:23,561
Aw, screw the roommate agreement!

11
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:25,596
No, you don't screw the
roommate agreement.

12
00:00:25,597 --> 00:00:28,332
The roommate agreement screws you.

13
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,734
You know what, go to Hell
and set their thermostat.

14
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:32,403
I don't have to go to Hell.

15
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:36,340
At 73 degrees, I'm there already!

16
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:41,946
Who is it?

17
00:00:41,947 --> 00:00:43,314
Leonard.

18
00:00:43,315 --> 00:00:45,316
Hang on.

19
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:51,767
Can I sleep on your couch tonight?

20
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:53,035
Uh, well, you can try,

21
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:55,237
but the people across the
hall are being very noisy.

22
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:57,673
You heard that, huh?

23
00:00:57,674 --> 00:01:00,709
Apparently, the one fella tried
to adjust the thermostat,

24
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,312
then the other fella
went bat-crap crazy.

25
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,481
So you agree, he's nuts.

26
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,717
Well, not as nuts as the guy
who chooses to live with him.

27
00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:10,786
Believe it or not,
he was worse when I met him.

28
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:13,155
Oh, I do not believe that.

29
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,658
You are so naive.

30
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,927
Just like I was seven years ago.

31
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:21,897
<i>I'd just started at the university.</i>

32
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:28,170
Excuse me, I'm looking

33
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,639
for Sheldon Cooper's apartment.

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,541
Oh, I bet you're here to
check out the room for rent.

35
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:34,977
Yeah. Run away, dude.

36
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:37,513
What?!

37
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,916
Run fast, run far.

38
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:43,919

been my first clue.

49
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:13,353
So Sheldon's last roommate
tried to warn you off?

50
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:17,086
For all I knew,
he was the crazy one.

51
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:19,589
He had this really deranged look.

52
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,625
Well, yeah, he'd been
living with Sheldon.

53
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:25,895
Sure, it makes sense <i>now.</i>

54
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:31,100
<i>Anyway, I went upstairs</i>
<i>and knocked on the door.</i>

55
00:02:36,874 --> 00:02:38,474
Yeah?

56
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,185
Dr. Cooper?

57
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:52,488
No, you want the crazy
guy across the hall.

58
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:59,662
<i>In retrospect, that was clue
number two.</i>

59
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:07,036
Yes?

60
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:08,638
I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

61
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,473
I called you about the apartment.
You said...

62
00:03:10,474 --> 00:03:11,574
I know what I said.

63
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:12,809
I know what you said.

64
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,378
I know what my mother
said on March 5, 1992.

65
00:03:16,513 --> 00:03:18,748
What is the sixth noble gas?

66
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:21,251
What? You said you're a scientist.

67
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:23,052
What is the sixth noble gas?

68
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:24,287
Uh, radon?

69
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,557
Are you asking me or telling me?

70
00:03:27,558 --> 00:03:29,559
Telling you?

71
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:34,364
Telling you.

72
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:36,566
All right, next question.

73
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:38,268
Kirk or Picard?

74
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:40,837
Oh, uh, well, that's tricky.

75
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:44,240
Um, Original Series over
<i>Next Generation,</i>

76
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:46,075
but Picard over Kirk.

77
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:47,944
Correct.

78
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,381
You've passed the first
barrier to roommate-hood.

79
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:53,750
You may enter.

80
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:56,185
Oh, this is pretty nice.

81
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,561
Uh, the bedrooms are back there?

82
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:06,729
That depends.

83
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,764
I don't understand--

84
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:10,233
their existence is conditional?

85
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:13,670
No, but your ability to perceive
their existence is conditional

86
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,239
on you passing the second
and third barriers.

87
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,774
There's three?

88
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:20,209
Each more daunting than the last.

89
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:22,578
Have a seat.

90
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,147
Okay.

91
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:26,616
No! That's where I sit!

92
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:32,221
What's the difference?

93
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:34,457
This seat is ideally located

94
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,759
both in relation to the
heat source in the winter

95
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,695
and a cross breeze in the summer.

96
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:41,164
It also faces the television
at a direct angle--

97
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:44,200
allowing me to immerse myself
in entertainment or game play

98
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,968
without being subjected
to conversation.

99
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:50,773
As a result, I've placed it
in a state of eternal dibs.

100
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:53,076
Can you do that?

101
00:04:53,077 --> 00:04:56,279
<i>Cathedra mea, regulae meae.</i>

102
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,383
That's Latin for "my chair,
my rules."

103
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:04,554
Now, you said on the phone

104
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,790
that your area of study is physics.

105
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,225
Uh, yeah, experimental physics.

106
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,828
Hmm...

107
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:13,763
What is that?

108
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:14,997
Doesn't concern you.

109
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:16,232
You'll be going

110
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,735
to the university every day? Yes.

111
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,036
And you have a vehicle?
A car, yeah.

112
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,471
And you'll be willing to drive me?

113
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:22,772
Can't you drive?

114
00:05:22,773 --> 00:05:24,741
I can.

115
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,011
I choose not to.

116
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:31,914
Okay, I suppose I could drive you.

117
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:34,951
That's a point in my favor, right?

118
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:37,353
Why don't you let me do this.

119
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:39,355
Come on, I just asked.

120
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:44,861
Last question.

121
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:46,129
In a post-apocalyptic world,

122
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,198
which task would you assign
the highest priority?

123
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,367
Locating a sustainable food source,

124
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:53,035
reestablishing a
functioning government,

125
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:55,872
procreating, or preserving
the knowledge of mankind?

126
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:59,275
Uh, I'm gonna go with...
preserving the knowledge.

127
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,443
That's correct.

128
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:05,948
FYI, I would have accepted any
answer other than procreating.

129
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:09,385
Come, I'll show you the
rest of the apartment.

130
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:10,520
Oh, good.

131
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:11,854
I passed the barriers.

132
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:14,457
The second barrier.
Don't get cocky.

133
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,662
This is the bathroom.

134
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:21,397
Are you fairly regular?

135
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,902
Uh, I guess.

136
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:28,337
This isn't going to
work if you're guessing.

137
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:31,841
When do you evacuate your bowels?

138
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:34,343
When I have to.

139
00:06:34,344 --> 00:06:35,912
When you have to?

140
00:06:35,913 --> 00:06:37,747
I'm sorry, I don't rent to hippies.

141
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:43,152
I-I'm sorry, uh, in the morning.

142
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,654
Around 8:00.

143
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:48,691
I can't give you 8:00.
I can give you 7:30.

144
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:50,493
Fine. I'll take it.

145
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,395
Third barrier passed.

146
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:55,698
You have won the right
to see your room.

147
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,366
Huzzah.

148
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,737
Is this it?

149
00:07:01,738 --> 00:07:03,105
No, this is my room.

150
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:04,874
People don't go in my room.

151
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,311
So where do you sleep?

152
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:10,112
I don't understand.

153
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:13,783
If people don't go in there,
and you're people, and...

154
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:16,452
You are people, aren't you?

155
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:18,921
Making a joke.

156
00:07:18,922 --> 00:07:20,623
Do you do this often?

157
00:07:20,624 --> 00:07:23,359
On occasion.

158
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:29,131
Your room.

159
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:39,308
You may want to repaint.

160
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:44,413
And after all that,
you just moved in?

161
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:45,515
I didn't just move in.

162
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:47,683
First we had to iron
out a few details.

163
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:51,187
"Roommates agree that Friday
nights shall be reserved

164
00:07:51,188 --> 00:07:52,154
"for watching Joss Whedon's

165
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:54,790
brilliant new series <i>Firefly."</i>

166
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:58,027
Does that really need
to be in the agreement?

167
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:01,864
We might as well settle it now;
it's going to be on for years.

168
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:04,333
Initial here.

169
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:11,073
All right, that's
television and movies.

170
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,143
Section nine: miscellany.

171
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,645
The apartment's flag

172
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:19,949
is a gold lion rampant
on a field of azure.

173
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,751
We have a flag?

174
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:33,362
Never fly it upside down.

175
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:36,499
Unless the apartment's in distress.

176
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,767
And next.

177
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,136
"If either of us ever
invents time travel,

178
00:08:40,137 --> 00:08:44,173
"we agree our first stop
will be this meeting today

179
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:46,442
in precisely five seconds."

180
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:50,112
Okay.

181
00:09:00,157 --> 00:09:02,458
That's disappointing.

182
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:06,996
Why on earth did you
agree to all that?

183
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:08,931
It was the best apartment I'd seen,

184
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:10,933
the rent was very reasonable

185
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:12,935
and after you've passed
the first three barriers

186
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:15,004
you kind of want to
take it all the way.

187
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:19,775
Well, I'm sorry, Leonard,
it's very hard to feel sympathy for you.

188
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:22,011
Okay, how about this?
Let me tell you about the first time

189
00:09:22,012 --> 00:09:22,945
I brought a girl over.

190
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:25,314
Leonard?

191
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,218
Shh. Just pretend we're not here.

192
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:33,122
Leonard?

193
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:35,391
I'm sure he'll go away.

194
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,630
I'm just going to keep
knocking till you answer.

195
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:41,731
Leonard?

196
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:43,199
Leonard?

197
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,367
Leonard?

198
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:45,868
What do you want?!

199
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:48,070
I didn't say come in!

200
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:49,972
You asked what I wanted.

201
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:51,607
I wanted to come in.

202
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:53,376
I'm here

203
00:09:53,377 --> 00:09:55,544
because you violated
our roommate agreement.

204
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:57,546
Specifically, section eight--

205
00:09:57,547 --> 00:10:01,117
visitors, subsection C;
females, paragraph four-- coitus.

206
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:03,152
"Roommates shall give each other

207
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:06,722
12 hours notice of
impending coitus."

208
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:09,925
I didn't even know
her 12 hours ago.

209
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:11,360
That's it! I'm out of here!

210
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,728
But, Joyce, come on.

211
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:14,363
12 hours?

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,701
Oh, my God.

213
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,269
Do I get some sympathy now?

214
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,304
A little bit.

215
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:27,143
Okay. Let me get this straight.

216
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:28,273
You move in with this guy,

217
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:30,875
he makes you sign a
ridiculous roommate agreement,

218
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:32,863
then he walks into your bedroom

219
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:35,499
while you're doing this Joyce Kim,
and you still stay?

220
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,268
Actually, I couldn't get too
mad at him about Joyce Kim.

221
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:39,603
Why not?

222
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:42,172
Well, I was doing some
government research at the time,

223
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:44,108
you know, military, rocket fuel.

224
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:45,375
It's kind of secret.

225
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:47,177
What does that have
to do with Joyce Kim?

226
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:50,481
As it turns out,
she was a North Korean spy.

227
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:53,851
Luckily, Sheldon drove her out

228
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:55,819
before I revealed
anything important.

229
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,689
Which I-I'm not
saying I would have.

230
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,858
So, what, that's it?

231
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:02,459
You've stayed with
Sheldon all this time

232
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,561
because he kept you from
going to federal prison?

233
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:05,996
That was part of it.

234
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:08,665
The other part is what
happened with the elevator.

235
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,833
Oh, yeah, I'm wondering about that.

236
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,668
You said it was working
when you moved in.

237
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:14,938
It was, but one night,
Sheldon came home from work...

238
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:26,850
What is going on here?

239
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:28,051
Hey, Sheldon.

240
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:29,186
This is Howard and Raj.

241
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:30,454
They work at the university, too.

242
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:31,722
Hey. Hey.

243
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:33,157
I'll get to you later.

244
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:35,859
What are you sitting on?

245
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,496
I can't speak for these guys,
but I'm sitting on my tushie.

246
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:41,865
It's a joke.

247
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:43,600
Not a good idea.

248
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:45,536
"Tushie" is buttocks, right?

249
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:48,572
Right. Hilarious.

250
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:50,641
Explain the couch.

251
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:51,775
Oh, well, there were some people

252
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:53,010
on the first floor moving out,

253
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:54,411
and they sold it to me for $100.

254
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:56,046
Howard and Raj helped
me bring it up.

255
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:59,049
But what's wrong with
the furniture we have?

256
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,019
They're lawn chairs.

257
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,720
And there was no place for company.

258
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:07,391
Did it occur to you
that was by design?

259
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:08,992
According to the
roommate agreement,

260
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:10,694
I'm entitled to allocate 50%

261
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:12,796
of the cubic footage
of the common areas.

262
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:14,965
But you didn't notify me by e-mail,

263
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:17,201
so this is still a breach.

264
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:19,036
I did notify you.

265
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:21,471
Oh, you did, did you?

266
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:37,955
Oh, drat!

267
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:43,026
Hoisted by my own spam filter.

268
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:45,028
What am I doing in
your spam folder?

269
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,663
I put you there after
you forwarded me

270
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:48,365
a picture of a cat
playing the piano,

271
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:49,900
entitled "This is funny."

272
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:52,336
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

273
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,538
That was hilarious.

274
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:56,440
Okay, what does all this
have to do with the elevator?

275
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:57,741
I'm getting to it.

276
00:12:57,742 --> 00:12:59,643
I assure you, you'll be sorry

277
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:01,979
you wasted your money on an iPod

278
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,815
when Microsoft comes
out with theirs.

279
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:09,052
Okay, do you have an
opinion about everything?

280
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:11,722
Yes.

281
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:14,291
And you just assume
you're always right?

282
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,860
It's not an assumption.

283
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:19,296
Change seats with me.

284
00:13:19,297 --> 00:13:21,298
Why? I don't like this spot.

285
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,033
I have to keep turning my head.

286
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:24,835
Fine.

287
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:27,804
Ooh, it's time for <i>Babylon 5!</i>

288
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:30,407
We don't watch <i>Babylon 5</i>
in this apartment.

289
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:31,475
Why not?

290
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:33,610
Because no one likes <i>Babylon 5.</i>

291
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:34,745
I like it.

292
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:35,879
Me, too. So do I.

293
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,447
There you go-- three against one.

294
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:38,715
They don't get a vote.

295
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:39,883
It's one against one.

296
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:41,785
And according to the
roommate agreement,

297
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:44,655
all ties will be settled by me.

298
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:46,890
But I said no to that.

299
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:49,092
And I said yes.

300
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:51,795
And I settle all ties.

301
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:56,933
Change seats with me.

302
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:58,135
Why?

303
00:13:58,136 --> 00:13:59,636
There's a draft on
my neck over here.

304
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:01,338
So, I get the draft?

305
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:03,807
You're protected
by your turtleneck.

306
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:06,343
Fine.

307
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:10,180
And it's a dickey.

308
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:19,556
Hmm...

309
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:21,825
I'm still not comfortable.

310
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:23,093
Of course.

311
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:24,761
There's too many people here.

312
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,531
We can fix that.

313
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:29,399
Let's leave.

314
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,735
Yeah, we can go over to my place.

315
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:32,803
Wait.

316
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:34,338
Let me get my jacket.

317
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,608
You're not going with us. Why not?

318
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:41,578
You're the guy we're
trying to get away from.

319
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,246
Oh.

320
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:45,782
Well, in that case,
I don't need my jacket.

321
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:48,919
And for the record,
the correct syntax is:

322
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,355
I'm the guy from whom
you're trying to get away.

323
00:15:00,431 --> 00:15:02,999
Oh, yes.

324
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:08,772
This is definitely
going to be my spot.

325
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,173
<i>Okay.</i>

326
00:15:10,174 --> 00:15:12,175
How do you know he said that?
You left the room.

327
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:16,079
Hey, do you want me to finish
working on your man feet or not?

328
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:19,349
Fine. Go ahead.

329
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,586
MRS. WOLOWITZ Howard,
are you having a playdate?

330
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:24,721
I don't have playdates!

331
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:26,590
I have colleagues!

332
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:30,227
Do their parents know they're here?

333
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:34,064
No, but if you keep screaming,
maybe they'll hear you!

334
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:40,070
That your dad?

335
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:45,409
She grows any more
hair on her face, yes.

336
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:47,677
Oh, man.

337
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:49,713
Is that a two-stage rocket?

338
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:52,416
Three. I designed
the engine myself.

339
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,684
Cool. Can it break Mach 1?

340
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:57,721
Oh, probably, if I could get
my hands on that new fuel

341
00:15:57,722 --> 00:15:59,656
the government's been working on.

342
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:01,658
Oh, this just might
be your lucky day.

343
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:03,860
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard,
what happened to the Oreos

344
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:06,430
I left on the counter?!

345
00:16:07,832 --> 00:16:10,967
I haven't seen your Oreos!

346
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:14,538
Just take your bath without them!

347
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:19,976
So, why was it his lucky day?

348
00:16:19,977 --> 00:16:20,977
Well, it turns out I had

349
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:22,245
a little rocket fuel
in the apartment.

350
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:24,948
What were you doing with
rocket fuel in your apartment?

351
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:26,650
Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious

352
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:28,251
about what I did for a living,

353
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:31,121
and I was going to
kind of show it to her.

354
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:34,090
It's not important. The point is,

355
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:36,126
the guys and I went
back to the apartment.

356
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:37,694
Are we ever going to
get to the elevator?

357
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:38,728
Yeah, we're really close.

358
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:39,930
Uh, uh, we're at the apartment.

359
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:42,065
The trick is to mix it into Tovex

360
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:43,900
in order to create
a combustible gel

361
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:46,970
that will generate over 8,
000 kilonewtons of thrust.

362
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:48,104
Cool. Nice.

363
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:49,406
Won't work.

364
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,343
Excuse me, but I've been
working on this a long time.

365
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:54,678
Trust me-- it'll work.

366
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,780
You don't see your mistake, do you?

367
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:58,381
There's no mistake.

368
00:16:58,382 --> 00:17:01,117
This is for a full-scale rocket,
not a model.

369
00:17:01,118 --> 00:17:02,752
Well, I've adjusted the formula.

370
00:17:02,753 --> 00:17:05,021
Not correctly.

371
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:06,990
Okay, I've had it with you.

372
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:08,758
You might be an expert

373
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,627
on theoretical physics and
science-fiction programs

374
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:12,929
and where to sit on
a freaking couch,

375
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,731
but this is applied physics.

376
00:17:14,732 --> 00:17:18,335
And when it comes to
applied physic... uh-oh.

377
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:19,503
What's happening?

378
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:21,304
A bad thing. A very bad thing.

379
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:22,372
Get the door.

380
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:23,874
Get the door! Get the door!

381
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,243
Get the door! Get the door!

382
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:38,355
You're waiting for the elevator?!

383
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:40,223
Oh. Right.

384
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:41,791
Wait. It's here.

385
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,964
Give me that.

386
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:53,136
What'd you do that for?
I had plenty of time...

387
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:00,443
You're welcome.

388
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:05,181
Not only did Sheldon save my life,

389
00:18:05,182 --> 00:18:07,017
he didn't rat me out
to the landlord.

390
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:08,184
Or the police.

391
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:10,487
Or Homeland Security.

392
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:12,355
Okay, so, basically,
you're the reason

393
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:15,191
I have to walk up and down three
flights of stairs every day?

394
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:16,459
So I did something stupid.

395
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,495
I'm sure you did stupid
things when you were younger.

396
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:20,030
What were you doing
seven years ago?

397
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,665
Excuse me, I was in high school.

398
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,700
Studying, keeping my nose clean,

399
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,835
doing volunteer work
for the community.

400
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:30,674
Not pregnant.

401
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:32,842
Yes!

402
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:42,820
Oh, Ubuntu,

403
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:46,991
you are my favorite
Linux-based operating system.

404
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,159
Hey.

405
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,161
Hello.

406
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,330
Why do I smell methacrylate?

407
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:54,999
Oh, uh, clear nail polish.

408
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,600
I had a mani-pedi.

409
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,503
Men can get those.

410
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,473
Anyway, I may owe you an apology.

411
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,709
There's doubt?

412
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,411
I did agree to the
thermostat setting,

413
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,547
and I shouldn't have
tried to change it.

414
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,415
That's not an apology.

415
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,585
Simply an acknowledgement
that I was right.

416
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,819
Okay, I'm sorry.

417
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,688
There you go.

418
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,023
So, we're good?

419
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,892
Good what?

420
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:23,494
Never mind.

421
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,462
Okay if I watch some TV?

422
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:27,231
Go ahead.

423
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,567
<i>Up next</i> Babylon 5.

424
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,270
You're not even watching!

425
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:34,505
I can hear it!

426
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,440
Oh, so the dialogue offends you?

427
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,642
I would hardly call that dialogue!

428
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:40,110
You're insane, you know that?!

429
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:41,812
Don't make me turn
that flag upside down,

430
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,414
'cause you know I'll do it!
