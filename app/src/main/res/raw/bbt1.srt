1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,920
Okay, Baby-Doll Pink...

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:08,632
...let's see if you can cover up the fact
that I got my dad's feet.

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,676
It's two degrees, Sheldon.

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,845
I just wanna turn up
the thermostat two degrees.

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,889
Let me point out
that two degrees can be the difference...

6
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,099
...between water and steam.

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,143
Yes, if we were lived in a tea kettle.

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,354
This is the temperature you
agreed to in the roommate agreement.

9
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,023
Screw the roommate agreement.

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,275
No, you don't screw
the roommate agreement...

11
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,111
...the roommate agreement screws you.

12
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,531
You know what,
go to hell and set their thermostat.

13
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:37,619
I don't have to go to hell.
At 73 degrees, I'm there already.

14
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,416
Who is it?

15
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,753
Leonard.
- Hang on.

16
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,135
Can I sleep on your couch tonight?

17
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,597
You can try, but the people
across the hall are being very noisy.

18
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:58,807
You heard that, huh?

19
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,685
Apparently, the one fella
tried to adjust the thermostat...

20
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,563
...then the other fella
went bat-crap crazy.

21
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,899
So you agree he's nuts.

22
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,651
Not as nuts as the guy
who chooses to live with him.

23
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,154
Believe it or not,
he was worse when I met him.

24
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,490
Oh, I do not believe that.

25
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,117
You are so naive.

26
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,119
Just like I was seven years ago.

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,415
I'd just started at the university.

28
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,007
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Sheldon Cooper's apartment.

29
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,593
- Oh. I bet you're here to check out the room.
- Yeah.

30
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,637
Run away, dude.

31
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,934
- What?
- Run fast, run far.

32
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,187
That should've been my first clue.

33
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,508
So Sheldon's last roommate
tried to warn you off?

34
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:18,053
For all I knew, he was the crazy one.

35
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,222
He had this really deranged look.

36
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,392
Well, yeah, he'd been living with Sheldon.

37
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,395
Sure, it makes sense now.

38
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,859
Anyway, I went upstairs
and knocked on the door.

39
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,408
Yeah?

40
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,918
Dr. Cooper?

41
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,046
No, you want the crazy guy
across the hall.

42
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,596
In retrospect, that was clue number two.

43
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,896
- Yes?
- I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

44
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,941
- I called about the apartment. You said-
- I know what I said. I know what you said.

45
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,944
I know what my mother said
on March 5th, 1992.

46
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,448
What is the sixth noble gas?

47
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,491
- What?
- You said you're a scientist.

48
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,078
- What is the sixth noble gas?
- Uh, Radon?

49
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,248
Are you asking me or telling me?

50
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,084
Telling you?

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,088
Telling you.

52
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,049
All right. Next question.

53
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,884
Kirk or Picard?

54
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,970
Oh, uh- Well, that's tricky. Um-

55
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:46,808
Well, original series over
Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.

56
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,560
Correct.

57
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,814
You've passed the first barrier
to roommatehood.

58
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,441
You may enter.

59
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,735
Oh, this is pretty nice.

60
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,412
- The bedrooms are back there?
- That depends.

61
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,999
I don't understand.
Their existence is conditional?

62
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,336
No. But your ability to
perceive their existence is conditional...

63
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,922
...on you passing
the second and third barriers.

64
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,759
- There's three?
- Each more daunting than the last.

65
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,680
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

66
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,683
No, that's where I sit.

67
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,854
What's the difference?

68
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,190
This seat is ideally located...

69
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:39,111
...in relation to the heat source in the
winter and a cross breeze in the summer.

70
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,571
It also faces the television
at a direct angle...

71
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,741
...allowing me to immerse myself
in entertainment or game play...

72
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,577
...without being subjected to conversation.
As a result...

73
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,998
...I've placed it in a state of eternal dibs.

74
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,792
Can you do that?

75
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,882
That's Latin for "My chair my rules. "

76
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:08,473
Now, you said on the phone
that your area of study is physics.

77
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,891
Yeah, experimental physics.

78
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,394
Hmm.

79
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,647
- What is that?
- Doesn't concern you.

80
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,567
You'll be going to the university
every day?

81
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,027
- Yes.
- Do you have a vehicle?

82
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,070
- A car.
- And you'd be willing to drive me?

83
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:26,158
- Well, can't you drive?
- I can.

84
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,619
I choose not to.

85
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,414
Okay, I suppose I could drive you.

86
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,586
- Well, what's a point in my favor, right?
- Why don't you let me do this?

87
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,921
Come on, I just asked.

88
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,928
Last question.
In a post-apocalyptic world...

89
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,598
...which task would you assign
the highest priority?

90
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,435
Locating a sustainable food source,
reestablishing a functioning government...

91
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,605
...procreation
or preserving the knowledge of mankind?

92
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,941
Uh, I'm gonna go with
preserving the knowledge.

93
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,027
That's correct.

94
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,448
FYI, I would've accepted
any answer other than procreating.

95
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,160
Come, I'll show you
the rest of the apartment.

96
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,579
Good. I passed the barriers.

97
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,956
The second barrier. Don't get cocky.

98
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,878
This is the bathroom.

99
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,963
Are you fairly regular?

100
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,887
- Uh- I guess.
- This isn't going to work if you're guessing.

101
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,474
When do you evacuate your bowels?

102
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,060
When I have to.

103
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,271
When you have to?
I'm sorry, I don't rent to hippies.

104
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,320
I'm sorry, in the morning. Around 8.

105
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,949
I can't give you 8. I can give you 7:30.

106
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,159
Fine, I'll take it.

107
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,994
Third barrier passed.

108
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,331
You have won the right to see your room.

109
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,833
Pizah.

110
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,755
- Is this it?
- No, this is my room.

111
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,674
People don't go in my room.

112
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,176
So where do you sleep? Heh.

113
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,846
I don't understand.

114
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,808
If people don't go in there,
and you're people and...

115
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,018
You are people, aren't you?

116
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,646
Making a joke.

117
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,356
Do you do this often?

118
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,859
On occasion.

119
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,115
Your room.

120
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,875
You may wanna repaint.

121
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,713
And after all that you just moved in?

122
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,383
I didn't just move in.
First we had to iron out a few details.

123
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,386
"Roommates agree
that Friday nights shall be reserved...

124
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,557
...for watching Joss Whedon's
brilliant new series, Firefly. "

125
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,060
Does that really need to be
in the agreement?

126
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,564
Might as well settle it now,
it's gonna be on for years.

127
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,734
Initial here.

128
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:11,281
All right, that's television and movies.

129
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,493
"Section nine: Miscellany.

130
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,748
The apartment's flag is a gold lion
rampant on a field of azure. "

131
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,250
We have a flag?

132
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,929
Never fly it upside down.

133
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,182
Unless the apartment's in distress.

134
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,892
Fine, next.

135
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,686
"If either of us ever invents time travel...

136
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:46,942
...we agree our first stop will be this
meeting today in precisely five seconds. "

137
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,654
Okay.

138
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,292
Well, that's disappointing.

139
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,587
Why on earth did you agree to all that?

140
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:11,633
It was the best apartment I'd seen,
the rent was very reasonable...

141
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,804
...and after you pass the first three barriers,
you kind of wanna take it all the way.

142
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,475
Well, I'm sorry, Leonard.
It's very hard to feel sympathy for you.

143
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,728
Okay. Let me tell you about the first time
I brought a girl over.

144
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,565
Leonard?

145
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,026
Shh. Just pretend we're not here.

146
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,488
Leonard?

147
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,950
I'm sure he'll go away.

148
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,787
I'm just gonna keep knocking
till you answer.

149
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,164
Leonard?

150
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,958
Leonard? Leonard?

151
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,501
What do you want?

152
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,753
I didn't say come in.

153
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,964
You asked what I want.

154
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,257
I wanted to come in.

155
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,261
I'm here because you violated
our roommate agreement.

156
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,846
Specifically, section eight...

157
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,850
...visitor's subsection C, females,
paragraph four, coitus.

158
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:07,439
"Roommates shall give each other
12 hours notice of impending coitus. "

159
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,108
I didn't even know her 12 hours ago.

160
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,193
That's it, I'm out of here.

161
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,445
Joyce, come on.

162
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,863
Twelve hours?

163
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,367
Oh, my God.

164
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,871
- Do I get some sympathy now?
- Little bit.

165
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,877
Let me get this straight.

166
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,505
You move in with this guy, makes
you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement.

167
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,634
Then he walks into your bedroom
while you're doing Joyce Kim...

168
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,843
...and you still stay?

169
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,679
Actually, I couldn't get too mad at him
about Joyce Kim.

170
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,056
Why not?

171
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,892
Well, I was doing some
government research at the time.

172
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,853
You know, military rocket fuels.
Kind of secret.

173
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,689
- What does that have to do with Joyce?
- As it turns out...

174
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,733
...she was a North Korean spy.

175
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,238
Luckily, Sheldon drove her out
before I revealed anything important.

176
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,283
Which I'm not saying I would have.

177
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,411
So you stayed with Sheldon
all this time...

178
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,997
...because he kept you from going
to federal prison?

179
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,085
That's part of it. The other part is
what happened with the elevator.

180
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,171
I've been wondering. You said
it was working when you moved in.

181
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,424
It was. But one night
Sheldon came home from work...

182
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,269
What is going on here?

183
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,898
Hey, this is Howard and Raj.
They work at the university too.

184
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,108
- Hey.
- Hey.

185
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,401
I'll get to you later.

186
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,278
What are you sitting on?

187
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,740
I can't speak for these guys,
but I'm sitting on my tushy. Heh, heh.

188
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,036
- It's a joke.
- Not a good idea.

189
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,789
- "Tushy" is "buttocks," right?
- Right.

190
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,666
Heh. Hilarious. Heh, heh.

191
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,085
Explain the couch.

192
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,964
There were people on the first floor
who were moving out and sold it for $100.

193
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,634
- Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.
- What's wrong with the furniture we have?

194
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,012
They are lawn chairs.

195
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,223
There was no place for company.

196
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,893
Did it occur to you that was by design?

197
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,522
According to the roommate agreement,
I'm entitled to allocate 50 percent...

198
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,607
...of the cubic footage
of common areas.

199
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:18,611
But you didn't notify me by e-mail,
so this is still a breach.

200
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,447
I did notify you.

201
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,949
Oh, you did, did you?

202
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,841
Drat.

203
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,471
Hoisted by my own spam filter.

204
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:48,016
- What am I doing in your spam?
- I put you there after you forwarded me...

205
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,186
...a picture of a cat playing
the piano entitled "This is funny. "

206
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,982
Oh, yeah. I saw that. That was hilarious.
Heh-heh-heh.

207
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,194
- What's this have to do with the elevator?
- I'm getting to it.

208
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:03,364
I assure you, you'll be sorry
you wasted your money on an iPod...

209
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,034
...when Microsoft comes out with theirs.

210
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,455
Okay, do you have an opinion
about everything?

211
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,540
Yes.

212
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,668
You just assume you're always right?

213
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,129
It's not an assumption.

214
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,466
- Change seats with me.
- Why?

215
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,385
I don't like this spot.
I have to keep turning my head.

216
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,387
Fine.

217
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,224
It's time for Babylon 5.

218
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,810
We don't watch Babylon 5
in this apartment.

219
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,021
- Why not?
- Because no one likes Babylon 5.

220
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,606
- I like it.
- Me too.

221
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,817
- So do I.
- There you go, three against one.

222
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,319
They don't get a vote. It's one against one.

223
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,865
And according to the roommate agreement,
all ties will be settled by me.

224
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,411
- But I said no to that.
- And I said yes.

225
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,039
And I settle all ties.

226
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,128
- Change seats with me.
- Why?

227
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,047
There's a draft on my neck over here.

228
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,757
So I get the draft?

229
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,051
You're protected by your turtleneck.

230
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,555
Fine.

231
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,432
And it's a dickey.

232
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,692
Hmm...

233
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,611
I'm still not comfortable.

234
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,030
Of course,
there's too many people here.

235
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,535
We can fix that. Let's leave.

236
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,329
Yeah, we can go over to my place.

237
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,582
Wait, let me get my jacket.

238
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,961
- You're not going with us.
- Why not?

239
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,964
You're the guy
we're trying to get away from.

240
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,133
Oh.

241
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,051
In that case, I don't need my jacket.

242
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,221
And for the record,
the correct syntax is:

243
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,433
"I'm the guy from whom
you're trying to get away. "

244
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,110
Oh, yes.

245
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,325
This is definitely gonna be my spot.

246
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,620
Okay. How do you know he said that?
You left the room.

247
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,332
Hey, do you want me to finish
working on your man-feet or not?

248
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,335
Fine. Go ahead.

249
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,464
Howard, are you having a playdate?!

250
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,800
I don't have playdates! I have colleagues!

251
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,387
Do their parents know they're here?!

252
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,308
No, but if you keep screaming,
maybe they'll hear you!

253
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,314
That your dad?

254
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,653
She grows any more hair on her face, yes.

255
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,115
Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?

256
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,035
Three. I designed the engine myself.

257
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,162
Cool. Can it break Mach 1?

258
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,248
Oh, probably, if I could get
my hands on that new fuel...

259
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,125
...the government's been working on.

260
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,127
Oh, this just might be your lucky day.

261
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:08,841
Howard, what happened to
the Oreos I left on the counter?!

262
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,762
I haven't seen your Oreos!

263
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,057
Just take your bath without them!

264
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,354
So why was it his lucky day?

265
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,148
It turns out I had a little rocket fuel
in the apartment.

266
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,859
What were you doing with
rocket fuel in your apartment?

267
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,487
Joyce Kim was curious
about what I did for a living...

268
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,365
...and I was gonna
kind of show it to her.

269
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,537
The point is, the guys and I
went back to the apartment.

270
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,416
- Are we ever gonna get to the elevator?
- We're close. We're at the apartment.

271
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,128
The trick is to mix it into Tovex in
order to create a combustible gel...

272
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,423
...that will generate over
8000 kilonewtons of thrust.

273
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,757
- Cool.
- Nice.

274
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,551
Won't work.

275
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,721
Excuse me, but I've been
working on this a long time.

276
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,222
Trust me, it'll work.

277
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,182
You don't see your mistake, do you?

278
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,767
There's no mistake.

279
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,562
This is for a full scale rocket,
not a model.

280
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,399
- Well, I've adjusted the formula.
- Not correctly.

281
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,401
Okay, I've had it with you.

282
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,363
You might be an expert on theoretical
physics and science fiction programs...

283
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:16,034
...and where to sit on a freaking couch,
but this is applied physics.

284
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,162
And when it comes to applied physics-
Uh-oh.

285
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,665
- What's happening?
- A bad thing. A very bad thing.

286
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,875
Get the door.

287
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,295
Get the door. Get the door. Get the door.

288
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,017
- You're waiting for the elevator?
- Oh, right.

289
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,771
- Wait. It's here.
- Ah!

290
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,317
Give me that.

291
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,489
What'd you do that for?
I had plenty of time.

292
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,662
You're welcome.

293
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,503
Not only did Sheldon save my life,
he didn't rat me out to the landlord.

294
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,672
Or the police. Or Homeland Security.

295
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,508
So you're the reason...

296
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,594
...I have to walk up and down
three flights of stairs every day?

297
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,597
So I did something stupid.
I'm sure you did stupid things.

298
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,474
What were you doing seven years ago?

299
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,019
Excuse me, I was in high school.
Studying, keeping my nose clean...

300
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,105
...doing volunteer work
for the community.

301
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:34,028
Not pregnant. Yes!

302
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,572
Ha, ha!

303
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:45,998
Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favorite
Linux-based operating system.

304
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,293
- Hey.
- Hello.

305
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,338
Why do I smell methacrylate?

306
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,383
Oh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi.

307
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,344
Men can get those.

308
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,389
Anyway, I may owe you an apology.

309
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,433
There's doubt?

310
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:08,521
I did agree to the thermostat setting
and I shouldn't have tried to change it.

311
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,648
That's not an apology.

312
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,526
That's simply an acknowledgment
that I was right.

313
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,279
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- There you go.

314
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,030
So we're good?

315
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,410
- Good what?
- Never mind.

316
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,289
- Okay if I watch some TV?
- Go ahead.

317
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,709
Up next: Babylon 5.

318
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,296
You're not even watching.
I can hear it.

319
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,381
Oh, so the dialogue offends you?

320
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,592
I would hardly call that dialogue.

321
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,343
You are insane, you know that?

322
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,389
Don't make me turn that flag
upside down because you know I'll do it.
