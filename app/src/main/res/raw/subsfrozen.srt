1
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,630
<i>Born of cold and winter air</i>

2
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,990
<i>And mountain rain combining</i>

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,150
<i>This icy force both foul and fair</i>

4
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,670
<i>Has a frozen heart worth mining</i>

5
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,550
<i>So cut through the heart</i>

6
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,030
<i>Cold and clear</i>

7
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,150
<i>Strike for love and strike for fear</i>

8
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,090
<i>See the beauty sharp and sheer</i>

9
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,030
<i>Split the ice apart</i>

10
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,040
<i>And break the frozen heart
Hup, ho</i>

11
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,480
<i>Watch your step
Let it go</i>

12
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,960
<i>Hup, ho</i>

13
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,760
<i>Watch your step
Let it go</i>

14
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,990
<i>Beautiful
Powerful</i>

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,350
<i>Dangerous
Cold</i>

16
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,670
<i>Ice has a magic
Can't be controlled</i>

17
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,910
<i>Stronger than one</i>

18
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,280
<i>Stronger than ten</i>

19
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,030
<i>Stronger than a hundred men!</i>

20
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,390
Oh!

21
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,830
<i>Born of cold
And winter air</i>

22
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,150
<i>And mountain rain combining</i>

23
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,550
<i>This icy force both foul and fair</i>

24
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,440
<i>Has a frozen heart worth mining</i>

25
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,710
<i>Cut through the heart</i>

26
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,910
<i>Cold and clear</i>

27
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,280
<i>Strike for love and strike for fear</i>

28
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,800
<i>There's beauty and there's danger here</i>

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,120
<i>Split the ice apart</i>

30
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,410
<i>Beware the frozen heart</i>

31
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,120
Come on, Sven.

32
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
Elsa. Psst!

33
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,560
Elsa!

34
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,880
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up!

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,520
Anna, go back to sleep.

36
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
I just can't.

37
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,120
The sky is awake, so I'm awake.

38
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,270
So, we have to play.

39
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,230
Go play by yourself.

40
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,440
Do you want to build a snowman?

41
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,030
Come on, come on, come on!

42
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,040
Do the magic!
Do the magic!

43
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,680
Oh...

44
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,120
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

45
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,320
This is amazing!

46
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,410
Watch this!

47
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,830
Hi, I'm Olaf, and
I like warm hugs.

48
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,640
I love you, Olaf!

49
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,080
Olaf...

50
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,600
Tickle bumps!

51
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,040
Oh!

52
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,760
Hang on!

53
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,030
Catch me!

54
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,070
Gotcha!

55
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,480
Again!

56
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,800
Wait!

57
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,680
- Whoo-hoo!
- Slow down!

58
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,830
Whoo!

59
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,240
Anna!

60
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,720
Anna!

61
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,240
Mama! Papa!

62
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,400
No, no...

63
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,390
You're okay, Anna. I got you.

64
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,040
Elsa, what have you done?

65
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,130
This is getting out of hand.

66
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,590
It was an accident.
I'm sorry, Anna!

67
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,560
- Oh. She's ice cold.
- I know where we have to go.

68
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,640
Ice?

69
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,110
Faster, Sven.

70
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,320
Sven!

71
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,280
Please! Help! It's my daughter.

72
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,670
It's the king.

73
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,430
- Trolls?
- Shush!

74
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm trying to listen.

75
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,170
Cuties. I'm going to keep you.

76
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,640
Your Majesty.

77
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,670
Born with the powers, or cursed?

78
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,200
Born.
And they're getting stronger.

79
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,730
Here, here.

80
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,560
You are lucky it wasn't her heart.

81
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,930
The heart is not so easily changed.

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,720
But the head can be persuaded.

83
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,610
Do what you must.

84
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,280
I recommend we remove all magic.

85
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,040
Even memories of magic,
to be safe.

86
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,000
But don't worry.
I'll leave the fun.

87
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,410
She will be okay.

88
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,080
But she won't
remember I have powers?

89
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,950
It's for the best.

90
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,480
Listen to me, Elsa.
Your power will only grow.

91
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,030
There is beauty in it...

92
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,350
But also great danger.

93
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,880
You must learn to control it.

94
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,760
Fear will be your enemy.

95
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,760
No!

96
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,310
We'll protect her.

97
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,590
She can learn to control it.
I'm sure.

98
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,150
<i>Until then...</i>

99
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,040
<i>We'll lock the gates.</i>

100
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,590
<i>We'll reduce the staff.</i>

101
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,080
<i>We will limit her contact with people,</i>

102
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,240
<i>and keep her powers
hidden from everyone.</i>

103
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,370
<i>Including Anna.</i>

104
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,720
Ah.

105
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,560
Elsa?

106
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,040
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

107
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,840
<i>Come on, let's go and play</i>

108
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,800
<i>I never see you anymore</i>

109
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,240
<i>Come out the door</i>

110
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,000
<i>It's like you've gone away</i>

111
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,120
<i>We used to be best buddies
And now we're not</i>

112
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,200
<i>I wish you would tell me why</i>

113
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,160
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

114
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,950
<i>It doesn't have to be a snowman</i>

115
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,710
Go away, Anna.

116
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,730
<i>Okay, bye</i>

117
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,090
The gloves will help.

118
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,470
See? Conceal it.

119
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,110
Don't feel it.

120
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,920
Don't let it show.

121
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,630
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

122
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,950
<i>Or ride our bike around the halls?</i>

123
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,150
<i>I think some company is overdue</i>

124
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,190
<i>I've started talking
To the pictures on the walls</i>

125
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,270
Hang in there, Joan.

126
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,960
<i>It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms</i>

127
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,890
<i>Just watching the hours tick by</i>

128
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,150
I'm scared.

129
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,230
It's getting stronger!

130
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,070
Getting upset only makes it worse.
Calm down.

131
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,870
No! Don't touch me!

132
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,200
Please, I don't want to hurt you.

133
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,880
See you in two weeks!

134
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,160
Do you have to go?

135
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,560
You'll be fine, Elsa.

136
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,520
Your Highness.

137
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,840
Elsa?

138
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,080
<i>Please
I know you're in there</i>

139
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,640
<i>People are asking where you've been</i>

140
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,520
<i>They say "Have courage"
And I'm trying to</i>

141
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,790
<i>I'm right out here for you</i>

142
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,200
<i>Just let me in</i>

143
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,250
<i>We only have each other
It's just you and me</i>

144
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,770
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

145
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,440
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

146
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,270
All ashore!

147
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,590
Welcome to Arendelle!

148
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,230
Watch your step, please.

149
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,990
The gates will be opening soon.

150
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,910
Why do I have to wear this?

151
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,150
Because the queen has come of age.

152
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,990
It's Coronation Day!

153
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's not my fault.

154
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,310
What do you want, Sven?

155
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,630
"Give me a snack."

156
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,310
What's the magic word?

157
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,390
"Please."

158
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,480
Uh! Uh-uh-uh. Share.

159
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,030
I can't believe they're
finally opening up the gates!

160
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,880
- And for a whole day!
- Faster, Percy!

161
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,200
Arendelle, our most
mysterious trade partner.

162
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,040
Open those gates so I may unlock your
secrets and exploit your riches.

163
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,920
Did I say that out loud?

164
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,510
Oh! Me sore eyes can't wait to
see the queen and the princess.

165
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,670
I bet they are absolutely lovely.

166
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,880
I bet they are beautiful.

167
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,510
Princess Anna?

168
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,800
- Princess Anna?
- Huh? Yeah?

169
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,870
Oh. Sorry to wake you, ma'am.

170
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,710
No, no, no, you didn't.

171
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,490
I've been up for hours.

172
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,160
Who is it?

173
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,870
Still me, ma'am.

174
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,750
The gates will open soon.
Time to get ready.

175
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,830
Of course.

176
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,070
Ready for what?

177
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,630
Your sister's coronation, ma'am.

178
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,160
My sister's corneration.

179
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,910
It's Coronation Day!

180
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,160
It's Coronation Day!

181
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,390
<i>The window is open!</i>

182
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,550
<i>So's that door!</i>

183
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,870
<i>I didn't know they did that anymore</i>

184
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,130
<i>Who knew we owned
8,000 salad plates?</i>

185
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,960
<i>For years I've roamed these empty halls</i>

186
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,560
<i>Why have a ballroom with no balls?</i>

187
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,960
<i>Finally
They're opening up the gates!</i>

188
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,790
<i>There'll be actual,
real, live people</i>

189
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,790
<i>It'll be totally strange</i>

190
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,050
<i>But wow!
Am I so ready for this change!</i>

191
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,640
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

192
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,430
<i>There'll be music</i>

193
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,350
<i>There'll be light</i>

194
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,590
<i>For the first time</i>

195
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,800
<i>In forever</i>

196
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,840
<i>I'll be dancing through the night</i>

197
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,990
<i>Don't know if I'm elated or gassy</i>

198
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,960
<i>But I'm somewhere in that zone</i>

199
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,000
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

200
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,790
<i>I won't be alone</i>

201
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,810
I can't wait to meet everyone!

202
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,230
What if I meet The One?

203
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,310
<i>Tonight
Imagine me gown and all</i>

204
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,630
<i>Fetchingly draped against the wall</i>

205
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,160
<i>The picture of sophisticated grace</i>

206
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,630
<i>I suddenly see him standing there</i>

207
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,870
<i>A beautiful stranger</i>

208
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,950
<i>Tall and fair</i>

209
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,630
<i>I wanna stuff some
chocolate in my face!</i>

210
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,350
<i>But then we laugh and talk all evening</i>

211
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,630
<i>Which is totally bizarre</i>

212
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,840
<i>Nothing like the life
I've led so far</i>

213
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,200
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

214
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,880
<i>There'll be magic
There'll be fun</i>

215
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,360
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

216
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,080
<i>I could be noticed by someone</i>

217
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,760
<i>And I know it is totally crazy</i>

218
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,400
<i>To dream I'd find romance</i>

219
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,400
<i>But for the first time in forever</i>

220
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,480
<i>At least I've got a chance!</i>

221
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
<i>Don't let them in</i>

222
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,400
<i>Don't let them see</i>

223
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,150
<i>Be the good girl</i>

224
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,930
<i>You always have to be</i>

225
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,240
<i>Conceal</i>

226
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,250
<i>Don't feel</i>

227
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,440
<i>Put on a show</i>

228
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,110
<i>Make one wrong move</i>

229
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,890
<i>And everyone will know</i>

230
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,670
<i>But it's only for today</i>

231
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,710
<i>It's only for today</i>

232
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,680
<i>It's agony to wait</i>

233
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,690
<i>Tell the guards to open up</i>

234
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,670
<i>The gate</i>

235
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,920
<i>The gate</i>

236
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,230
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

237
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,590
<i>Don't let them in
Don't let them see</i>

238
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,430
<i>I'm getting what I'm dreaming of</i>

239
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,510
<i>Be the good girl</i>

240
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,830
<i>You always have to be</i>

241
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,230
<i>A chance to change</i>

242
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,070
<i>My lonely world</i>

243
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,390
Conceal

244
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,710
<i>A chance to find true love</i>

245
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,790
<i>Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know</i>

246
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,950
<i>I know it all ends tomorrow</i>

247
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,970
<i>So it has to be today!</i>

248
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,960
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

249
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,750
<i>For the first time</i>

250
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,360
<i>In forever</i>

251
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,320
<i>Nothing's in my way!</i>

252
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,110
Hey!

253
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,650
I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

254
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,950
Hey.

255
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,950
Uh...
No, no, I'm okay.

256
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,150
Are you sure?

257
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,910
Yeah. I just wasn't looking
where I was going.

258
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,200
But I'm great, actually.

259
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Oh... Thank goodness.

260
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,390
Oh! Uh...

261
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,320
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

262
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

263
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,110
"Princess"? My Lady.

264
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,520
Oh!

265
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,270
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

266
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,840
- Um...
- Whew.

267
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,270
Hi. Again.

268
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,200
Oh, boy!

269
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,030
This is awkward.

270
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,710
Not "You're awkward,"
but just because we're...

271
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,240
I'm awkward, you're gorgeous.
Wait, what?

272
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,510
I'd like to formally apologize

273
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,920
for hitting the princess
of Arendelle with my horse.

274
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,190
And for every moment after.

275
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,790
No! No, no. It's fine.

276
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,110
I'm not that princess.

277
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,870
I mean, if you had
hit my sister Elsa,

278
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,710
it would be... Yeesh!

279
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,270
Because, you know...

280
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,670
Hello.

281
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,480
But, lucky you,

282
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,440
It's just me.

283
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,080
"Just" you?

284
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,240
The bells. The coronation.

285
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,350
I better go.

286
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,130
I have to go. I better go. Uh...

287
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,800
Bye!

288
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,320
Oh, no. Oh!

289
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,800
Your Majesty, the gloves.

290
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,600
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

291
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,120
Queen Elsa of Arendelle!

292
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,770
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

293
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,320
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

294
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,670
Oh. Here? Are you sure?

295
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,870
Because I don't think
I'm supposed to...

296
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,320
Oh. Okay.

297
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,440
Hi.

298
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,440
"Hi" me? Oh...

299
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,330
Um... Hi.

300
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,350
You look beautiful.

301
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,470
Thank you.
You look beautiful-ler.

302
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,030
I mean, not "fuller."
You don't look fuller.

303
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,150
But more beautiful.

304
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,160
Thank you.

305
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,520
So...

306
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,600
This is what a party looks like.

307
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,390
It's warmer than I thought.

308
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,670
What is that amazing smell?

309
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,720
Chocolate.

310
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,920
Your Majesty.

311
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,040
- The Duke of Weaseltown.
- "Weselton"!

312
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,040
Duke of Weselton, Your Majesty.

313
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,670
As your closest partner in
trade it seems only fitting

314
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,870
that I offer you

315
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,650
your first dance as queen.

316
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,360
One-two, and jump.

317
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,880
Uh...

318
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,910
Thank you. Only, I don't dance.

319
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,190
Oh...

320
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,230
But my sister does.

321
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,590
- What?
- Oh! Lucky you.

322
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,710
Oh, I don't think...

323
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,120
If you swoon, let me know.
I'll catch you.

324
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,830
Sorry.

325
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,710
Like an agile peacock.

326
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,630
Ow! Ow.

327
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,710
Speaking of, so great
to have the gates open.

328
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,920
Why did they shut them
in the first place?

329
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,710
Do you know the reason? Hmm?

330
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,550
- No.
- No.

331
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,090
All right. Hang on!

332
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,910
They don't call me
the "Little Dipper" for nothing!

333
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,070
Oh-ho!

334
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,720
Like a chicken with the face
of a monkey, I fly.

335
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,710
Let me know
when you're ready

336
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,910
for another round, Milady.

337
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,850
Well, he was sprightly.

338
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,070
Especially for a man in heels.

339
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,850
Are you okay?

340
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,640
I've never been better.
This is so nice.

341
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,120
I wish it could be
like this all the time.

342
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,960
Me, too.

343
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,670
But it can't.

344
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,880
- Why not?
- It just can't.

345
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,770
Excuse me for a minute.

346
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,240
I'd be honored.

347
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,880
Glad I caught you.

348
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,320
Hans.

349
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,360
Oop.

350
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,670
I often had a whole parlor
to myself to slide!

351
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,710
- Oh!
- Oops!

352
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,110
Sorry.

353
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,510
Your physique helps,
I'm sure, too.

354
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,000
Ah.

355
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,470
What's this?

356
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,950
Uh, I was born with it.

357
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,360
Although, I dreamed
I was kissed by a troll.

358
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,790
I like it.

359
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,470
Yeah, the whole thing.

360
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,760
You got it.

361
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,760
Okay, wait, wait.
So, you have how many brothers?

362
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,880
Twelve older brothers.

363
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,510
Three of them pretended I was
invisible, literally, for two years.

364
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,840
That's horrible.

365
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,480
It's what brothers do.

366
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,210
And sisters.

367
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,710
Elsa and I were really close
when we were little.

368
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,190
But then, one day,
she just shut me out,

369
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,720
and I never knew why.

370
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,190
I would never shut you out.

371
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,160
Okay, can I just say
something crazy?

372
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,760
I love crazy.

373
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,640
<i>All my life has been
A series of doors in my face</i>

374
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,590
<i>And then suddenly
I bump into you</i>

375
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,950
I was thinking the same
thing, because, like...

376
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,110
<i>I've been searching my whole life</i>

377
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,200
<i>To find my own place</i>

378
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,870
<i>And maybe it's the party talking</i>

379
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,950
<i>Or the chocolate fondue</i>

380
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,070
<i>But with you</i>

381
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,310
<i>But with you I found my place</i>

382
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,030
<i>I see your face</i>

383
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,030
<i>And it's nothing like
I've ever known before</i>

384
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,070
<i>Love is an open</i>

385
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,400
<i>Door!</i>

386
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,030
<i>Love is an open</i>

387
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,350
<i>- Door
- Door</i>

388
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,710
<i>Love is an open door</i>

389
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,470
<i>- With you
- With you</i>

390
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,440
<i>Love is an open door</i>

391
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,150
<i>- I mean, it's crazy</i>
- What?

392
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,520
<i>- We finish each other's
- Sandwiches</i>

393
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,750
That's what I was gonna say!

394
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,950
<i>I've never met someone</i>

395
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,070
<i>Who thinks so much like me</i>

396
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,550
Jinx! Jinx again!

397
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,200
<i>Our mental synchronization
Can have but one explanation</i>

398
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,670
<i>- You
- And I</i>

399
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,750
<i>- Were
- Just</i>

400
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,450
<i>Meant to be</i>

401
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,950
<i>- Say goodbye
- Say goodbye</i>

402
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,000
<i>To the pain of the past</i>

403
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,640
<i>We don't have to feel it anymore</i>

404
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,840
<i>Love is an open door</i>

405
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,190
<i>Love is an open</i>

406
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,390
<i>- Door
- Door</i>

407
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,310
<i>Life can be so much more</i>

408
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,310
<i>- With you
- With you</i>

409
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,670
<i>Love is an open</i>

410
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,360
<i>- Door
- Door</i>

411
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,640
Can I say something crazy?

412
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,640
Will you marry me?

413
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,840
Can I say something even crazier?

414
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,400
Yes!

415
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
- Coming through.
- Excuse me. Oh...

416
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,550
- Pardon. Sorry.
- Oh!

417
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,280
Can we just get around you there?

418
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,440
Thank you. Oh! There she is.

419
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,630
Elsa!

420
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,470
I mean, Queen. Me again. Um...

421
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,280
May I present Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.

422
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,170
Your Majesty.

423
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,750
We would like...

424
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,870
Uh, your blessing...

425
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,000
Of our marriage.

426
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,280
- Marriage?
- Yes!

427
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,830
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

428
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,150
Well, we haven't worked out
all the details ourselves.

429
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,070
We'll need a few days
to plan the ceremony.

430
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,390
Of course, we'll have soup, roast
and ice cream. And then...

431
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,760
Wait. Would we live here?

432
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,990
- Here?
- Absolutely!

433
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,070
- Anna!
- Oh!

434
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,670
We can invite all 12 of your
brothers to stay with us.

435
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,950
What? No, no, no.

436
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,280
- Of course we have the room.
- Wait, slow down.

437
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,310
No one's brothers are staying here.

438
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,880
No one is getting married.

439
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,510
Wait, what?

440
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,560
May I talk to you, please? Alone.

441
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,800
No. Whatever you have to say,
you can say to both of us.

442
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,200
Fine. You can't marry
a man you just met.

443
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,230
You can if it's true love.

444
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,230
Anna, what do you know
about true love?

445
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,350
More than you.

446
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,190
All you know is how
to shut people out.

447
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,170
You asked for my blessing,
but my answer is no.

448
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,790
Now, excuse me.

449
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,430
Your Majesty,
if I may ease your...

450
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,720
No, you may not.
And I think you should go.

451
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,830
The party is over. Close the gates.

452
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,910
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- What?

453
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,590
Elsa, no, no! Wait.

454
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,800
Give me my glove!

455
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,710
Elsa, please, please.

456
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,600
I can't live like this anymore!

457
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,520
Then leave.

458
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,710
What did I ever do to you?

459
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,910
Enough, Anna.

460
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,160
No, why?
Why do you shut me out?

461
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,880
Why do you shut the world out?

462
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,720
What are you so afraid of?

463
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,690
I said, enough!

464
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,200
Sorcery.

465
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,280
I knew there was something
dubious going on here.

466
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,240
Elsa.

467
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,440
There she is!

468
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,350
Yes! It is her!

469
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,680
Queen Elsa.

470
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,450
Our beautiful queen!

471
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,920
Your Majesty?
Are you all right?

472
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,280
No.

473
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,240
There she is! Stop her!

474
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,470
Please, just stay away from me.
Stay away.

475
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,960
Monster. Monster!

476
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,000
Elsa!

477
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,920
Elsa!

478
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,280
Wait, please!

479
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,630
Elsa, stop!

480
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,990
Anna!

481
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,200
No.

482
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,160
The fjord.

483
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,920
- Snow!
- Snow?

484
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,190
Yes, snow.

485
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,110
- Are you all right?
- No.

486
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,760
Did you know?

487
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,480
No.

488
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,830
Look, it's snowing.
It's snowing!

489
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,550
The queen has cursed this land!

490
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,790
She must be stopped!
You have to go after her.

491
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,190
Wait, no!

492
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,710
You! ls there sorcery in you, too?

493
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,350
Are you a monster, too?

494
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,350
No, no. I'm completely ordinary.

495
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,050
That's right, she is.

496
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,520
In the best way.

497
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,150
And my sister is not a monster.

498
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,790
She nearly killed me!

499
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,390
- You slipped on ice.
- Her ice.

500
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,840
It was an accident. She was scared.

501
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,890
She didn't mean it.
She didn't mean any of this.

502
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,630
Tonight was my fault.
I pushed her.

503
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,030
So, I'm the one

504
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,310
- that needs to go after her.
- What?

505
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,710
- Bring me my horse, please.
- Anna, no.

506
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,120
It's too dangerous.

507
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,130
Elsa is not dangerous.

508
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,270
I'll bring her back,
and I'll make this right.

509
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,350
I'm coming with you.

510
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,760
No, I need you here
to take care of Arendelle.

511
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,760
On my honor.

512
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,440
I leave Prince Hans in charge.

513
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,120
Are you sure you can trust her?

514
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,170
I don't want you getting hurt.

515
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,800
She's my sister.

516
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,730
She would never hurt me.

517
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,950
<i>The snow glows white
On the mountain tonight</i>

518
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,160
<i>Not a footprint to be seen</i>

519
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,950
<i>A kingdom of isolation</i>

520
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,000
<i>And it looks like
I'm the queen</i>

521
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,550
<i>The wind is howling</i>

522
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,480
<i>Like this swirling storm inside</i>

523
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:49,360
<i>Couldn't keep it in
Heaven knows I tried</i>

524
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,790
<i>Don't let them in
Don't let them see</i>

525
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,310
<i>Be the good girl
You always have to be</i>

526
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,240
<i>Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know</i>

527
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,680
<i>Well, now they know</i>

528
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,400
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

529
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,760
<i>Can't hold me back anymore</i>

530
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,240
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

531
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,800
<i>Turn away and slam the door</i>

532
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,910
<i>I don't care</i>

533
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,400
<i>What they're going to say</i>

534
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,440
<i>Let the storm rage on</i>

535
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,730
<i>The cold never bothered me anyway</i>

536
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:46,040
<i>It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small</i>

537
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,030
<i>And the fears that once controlled me</i>

538
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,130
<i>Can't get to me at all</i>

539
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,950
<i>It's time to see what I can do</i>

540
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,510
<i>To test the limits and break through</i>

541
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,030
<i>No right, no wrong</i>

542
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,320
<i>No rules for me</i>

543
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,560
<i>I'm free!</i>

544
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,690
<i>Let it go!</i>

545
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,610
<i>Let it go!</i>

546
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,070
<i>I am one with the wind and sky</i>

547
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,600
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

548
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,320
<i>You'll never see me cry</i>

549
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,270
<i>Here I stand</i>

550
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,130
<i>And here I'll stay</i>

551
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,000
<i>Let the storm rage on</i>

552
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,030
<i>My power flurries through the air</i>

553
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,400
<i>Into the ground</i>

554
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,310
<i>My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals</i>

555
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,640
<i>All around</i>

556
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,080
<i>And one thought crystallizes
Like an icy blast</i>

557
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,680
<i>I'm never going back</i>

558
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,090
<i>The past is in the past</i>

559
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,680
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

560
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,590
<i>And I'll rise like the break of dawn</i>

561
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,000
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

562
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,190
<i>That perfect girl is gone</i>

563
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,750
<i>Here I stand</i>

564
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,680
<i>In the light of day</i>

565
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,600
<i>Let the storm rage on!</i>

566
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,210
<i>The cold never bothered me anyway</i>

567
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,650
Elsa!

568
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,200
Elsa!

569
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,600
Elsa, it's me, Anna,

570
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,850
your sister who didn't mean
to make you freeze the summer.

571
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,160
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

572
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,070
Of course, none of it
would have happened

573
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,040
if she had just told me her secret.

574
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,210
She's a stinker.

575
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,400
Whoa!

576
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,840
Oh, no. No, no, no!
Come back!

577
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,410
No, no, no!

578
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,650
Okay.

579
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,360
Snow. It had to be snow.

580
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,430
She couldn't have
had tropical magic

581
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,000
that covered the fjords
in white sand and warm...

582
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,270
Fire!

583
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,730
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.

584
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,720
Ooh. "And sauna"!

585
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,610
- Yoo-hoo.
- Hmm?

586
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,160
Big summer blowout.

587
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,590
Half off swimming suits, clogs,

588
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,400
and a sun balm of my
own invention, yah?

589
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,000
Oh. Great.
For now, um, how about boots?

590
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,320
Winter boots and dresses?

591
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,760
That would be in our
winter department.

592
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,130
Oh. Um...

593
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,790
I was just wondering.

594
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,040
Has another young woman...

595
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,710
The queen perhaps,
I don't know,

596
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,950
passed through here?

597
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,430
The only one crazy enough
to be out in this storm

598
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
is you, dear.

599
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,470
You and this fellow.

600
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,510
Yoo-hoo.

601
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,840
Big summer blowout.

602
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,990
Carrots.

603
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,320
Huh?

604
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,250
Behind you.

605
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,560
Oh! Right. Excuse me.

606
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,840
Oh. A real howler in July, yes?

607
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,400
Wherever could it be coming from?

608
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,610
The North Mountain.

609
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,520
North Mountain.

610
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,110
That will be 40.

611
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,870
Forty? No, 10.

612
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,120
Oh, dear, that's no good.

613
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,150
See, this is from our winter stock,

614
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,150
where supply and demand
have a big problem.

615
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,360
You want to talk about
a supply and demand problem?

616
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,720
I sell ice for a living.

617
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,990
Ooh. That's a rough business
to be in right now.

618
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,350
I mean, that is really...

619
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,720
That's unfortunate.

620
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,990
Still 40.

621
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,240
But I will throw in
a visit to Oaken's sauna.

622
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,400
Yoo-hoo. Hi, family.

623
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,080
Yoo-hoo!

624
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,840
Ten is all I got. Help me out.

625
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,800
Okay. Ten will get you
this and no more.

626
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,070
Okay, just tell me one thing.

627
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,030
What was happening
on the North Mountain?

628
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,950
Did it seem magical?

629
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,650
Yes!

630
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,080
Now, back up while I deal
with this crook, here.

631
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,650
What did you call me?

632
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,410
Okay, okay. I'm out.

633
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,790
Whoa!

634
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,280
Bye-bye.

635
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,440
No, Sven,
I didn't get your carrots.

636
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,360
But I did find us a place to sleep.

637
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,570
And it's free.

638
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,490
I'm sorry about this violence.

639
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,250
I will add a quart of lutefisk,

640
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,090
so we have good feelings.

641
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,930
Just the outfit and the boots, yah?

642
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,360
Uh...

643
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,880
<i>Reindeers are better than people</i>

644
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,840
<i>Sven, don't you think that's true?</i>

645
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,230
<i>"Yeah, people will beat you
And curse you and cheat you</i>

646
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,840
<i>"Every one of them's bad,
except you"</i>

647
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,800
Aw. Thanks, buddy.

648
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,440
<i>But people smell better
than reindeers</i>

649
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,760
<i>Sven, don't you think I'm right?</i>

650
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,160
<i>"That's once again true
For all, except you"</i>

651
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,470
<i>You got me
Let's call it a night</i>

652
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,400
<i>"Good night"</i>

653
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,120
<i>Don't let the frostbite</i>

654
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,600
<i>Bite</i>

655
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,840
Nice duet.

656
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,920
It's just you.
What do you want?

657
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,560
I want you to take me up
the North Mountain.

658
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,490
I don't take people places.

659
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,750
Let me rephrase that.

660
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,400
Hey.

661
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,480
Take me up the North Mountain.

662
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,160
Please.

663
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,360
Look, I know how to
stop this winter.

664
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,330
We leave at dawn.

665
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,920
And you forgot the
carrots for Sven.

666
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,990
Oops, sorry.

667
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,480
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...

668
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,200
We leave now. Right now.

669
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,480
Whew!

670
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,390
Hang on! We like to go fast.

671
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,910
- I like fast.
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

672
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,630
Get your feet down.
This is fresh lacquer.

673
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,230
Seriously,
were you raised in a barn?

674
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,670
Ugh!

675
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,480
- No, I was raised in a castle.
- Hmm.

676
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,400
So, uh, tell me,

677
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,640
what made the queen
go all ice-crazy?

678
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,880
Oh. Well...

679
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,640
It was all my fault.

680
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,110
I got engaged,
but then she freaked out,

681
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,970
because I'd only just met him,
you know, that day.

682
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,870
And she said she wouldn't
bless the marriage, and...

683
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,430
Wait. You got engaged
to someone you just met that day?

684
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,750
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad,
and so she got mad,

685
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,870
and then she tried to walk away,
and I grabbed her glove...

686
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,030
Hang on!

687
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,990
You mean to tell me you got engaged

688
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,670
to someone you just met that day?

689
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,120
Yes. Pay attention.

690
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,190
But the thing is, she wore
the gloves all the time,

691
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,630
so I just thought, maybe
she has a thing about dirt.

692
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,680
Didn't your parents ever
warn you about strangers?

693
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,160
Yes, they did.

694
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,960
But Hans is not a stranger.

695
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,950
Oh, yeah? What's his last name?

696
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,550
"Of the Southern Isles."

697
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,990
- What's his favorite food?
- Sandwiches.

698
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,390
- Best friend's name?
- Probably John.

699
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,510
- Eye color?
- Dreamy.

700
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,070
- Foot size?
- Foot size doesn't matter.

701
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,910
Have you had a meal with him yet?
What if you hate the way he eats?

702
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,530
What if you hate the
way he picks his nose?

703
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,800
Picks his nose?

704
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,990
And eats it.

705
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,600
Excuse me, sir.
He is a prince.

706
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,120
- All men do it.
- Ew.

707
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,550
Look, it doesn't matter.
It's true love.

708
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,520
- It doesn't sound like true love.
- Are you some sort of love expert?

709
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,800
No. But, uh,
I have friends who are.

710
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,230
You have friends

711
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,630
who are love experts?
I'm not buying it.

712
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,310
- Stop talking.
- No, no, no. No, no.

713
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,090
- I'd like to meet these...
- No, I mean it.

714
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,150
Sven, go.

715
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,400
Go!

716
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,470
- What are they?
- Wolves.

717
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,720
Wolves?

718
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,470
- What do we do?
- I got this.

719
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,750
You just...
Don't fall off, and don't get eaten.

720
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,790
But I want to help!

721
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,910
- No.
- Why not?

722
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,990
Because I don't trust
your judgment.

723
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,270
Excuse me?

724
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,110
Who marries a man she just met?

725
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,430
It's true love!

726
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,670
Whoa!

727
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,290
Whoa. Whoa!

728
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,880
Christopher!

729
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,310
It's "Kristoff"!

730
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,850
Ow!

731
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,110
Duck!

732
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,750
You almost set me on fire!

733
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,960
But I didn't.

734
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,750
Get ready to jump, Sven!

735
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,270
You don't tell him what to do.

736
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,840
- Hey!
- I do!

737
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,870
Jump, Sven!

738
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,120
Phew!

739
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,880
But I just paid it off.

740
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,040
Uh-oh. No. No.

741
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,510
No!

742
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,390
Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

743
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,680
Grab on!

744
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,190
Pull, Sven. Pull!

745
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,230
Whoa.

746
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,680
I'll replace your sled,
and everything in it.

747
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,280
And I understand if you don't
want to help me anymore.

748
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,440
Of course I don't want to help
her anymore. In fact,

749
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,030
this whole thing has ruined me
for helping anyone ever again.

750
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,070
It's this way?

751
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,190
"She'll die on her own."

752
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,080
- I can live with that.
- Here we go.

753
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,310
"But you won't get
your new sled if she's dead."

754
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,930
I think, actually, it's up.

755
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,390
Sometimes, I really don't like you.

756
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,920
Hold up! We're coming.

757
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,390
You are?

758
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,550
I mean, sure.
I'll let you tag along.

759
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,200
Arendelle.

760
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,920
It's completely frozen.

761
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,070
But it will be fine.
Elsa will thaw it.

762
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,430
Will she?

763
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,110
Yeah. Now, come on.

764
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,950
This way to the North Mountain?

765
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,590
More like this way.

766
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:21,160
I never knew winter
could be so beautiful.

767
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,550
Yeah.

768
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,680
It really is beautiful, isn't it?

769
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,360
But it's so white.

770
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,610
You know, how about a little color?

771
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,990
I'm thinking maybe some
crimson, chartreuse.

772
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,640
How about yellow?

773
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,960
No, not yellow.
Yellow and snow?

774
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,470
No go.

775
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,930
Am I right?

776
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,230
- Hi.
- You're creepy.

777
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,630
- Whoa!
- I don't want it.

778
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,070
- Back at you.
- Please don't drop me.

779
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,350
- No.
- Come on, it's just a head.

780
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,670
All right.
We got off to a bad start.

781
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,080
Ew, ew, ew, the body!

782
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,790
Wait, what am I
looking at right now?

783
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,510
Why are you hanging off
the earth like a bat?

784
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,990
All right, wait one second.

785
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,530
Oh. Uh...

786
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,750
Oh!

787
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,320
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

788
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,390
Now, I'm perfect.

789
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,080
Well, almost.

790
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,150
It was like my whole life
got turned upside down.

791
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,440
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry!

792
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,350
- Head rush!
- I was just... Are you okay?

793
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,870
Are you kidding me?
I am wonderful!

794
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,730
I've always wanted a nose.

795
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,110
So cute.

796
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,870
It's like a little baby unicorn.

797
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,990
But... Hey! Whoa!

798
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,030
Oh.

799
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,040
I love it even more.

800
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,080
All right, let's start this thing over.

801
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,230
Hi, everyone.

802
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,310
I'm Olaf.

803
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,720
And I like warm hugs.

804
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,280
Olaf?

805
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,400
That's right. Olaf.

806
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,600
And you are?

807
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,080
Oh. Um...

808
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,230
I'm Anna.

809
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,670
And who's the funky-looking
donkey over there?

810
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,230
- That's Sven.
- Uh-huh.

811
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,190
And who's the reindeer?

812
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,230
Sven.

813
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,070
Oh, the... Oh. Okay.
That makes things easier for me.

814
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,760
Aw, look at him
trying to kiss my nose.

815
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,880
- I like you, too.
- Olaf.

816
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,520
- Did Elsa build you?
- Yeah. Why?

817
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,750
Do you know where she is?

818
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,910
- Fascinating.
- Yeah. Why?

819
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,470
Do you think you could
show us the way?

820
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,680
Yeah. Why?

821
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,110
How does this work? Ow!

822
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,350
Stop it, Sven.
I'm trying to focus, here.

823
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,560
- Yeah. Why?
- I'll tell you why.

824
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,640
We need Elsa to bring back summer.

825
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,510
- Summer?
- Mmm-hmm.

826
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,830
Oh. I don't know why,

827
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,590
but I've always loved
the idea of summer.

828
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,190
And sun, and all things hot.

829
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,270
Really?

830
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,830
I'm guessing you don't have
much experience with heat.

831
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,120
Nope.

832
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,750
But sometimes I like
to close my eyes,

833
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,800
and imagine what it would be
like when summer does come.

834
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:49,110
<i>Bees will buzz
Kids will blow dandelion fuzz</i>

835
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:54,080
<i>And I'll be doing
Whatever snow does in summer</i>

836
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,830
<i>A drink in my hand</i>

837
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,230
<i>My snow up against the burning sand</i>

838
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,510
<i>Probably getting gorgeously tanned</i>

839
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,290
<i>In summer</i>

840
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,870
<i>I'll finally see a summer breeze</i>

841
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,990
<i>Blow away a winter storm</i>

842
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,270
<i>And find out what happens
to solid water</i>

843
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,210
<i>When it gets warm</i>

844
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,990
<i>And I can't wait to see</i>

845
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,040
<i>What my buddies all think of me</i>

846
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,790
<i>Just imagine how much cooler I'll be</i>

847
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,200
<i>In summer!</i>

848
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,670
<i>The hot and the cold
are both so intense</i>

849
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,240
<i>Put them together
It just makes sense</i>

850
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,670
<i>Winter's a good time
To stay in and cuddle</i>

851
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,720
<i>But put me in summer and I'll be a...</i>

852
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,590
<i>Happy snowman!</i>

853
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,870
<i>When life gets rough</i>

854
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,400
<i>I like to hold on to my dream</i>

855
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,400
<i>Relaxing in the summer sun
Just letting off steam</i>

856
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,550
<i>Oh, the sky</i>

857
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,280
<i>Will be blue</i>

858
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,720
<i>And you guys will be there, too</i>

859
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,670
<i>When I finally do</i>

860
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,160
<i>What frozen things do
In summer!</i>

861
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,880
- I'm gonna tell him.
- Don't you dare.

862
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,680
<i>In summer!</i>

863
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,550
So, come on! Elsa's this way.

864
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,750
Let's go bring back summer!

865
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,200
I'm coming!

866
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,520
Somebody's gotta tell him.

867
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,030
No, no. You've got
the bark facing down.

868
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,760
The bark needs to be face-up.

869
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,230
- Bark down is drier.
- Bark up!

870
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,270
- Bark down!
- Papa!

871
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,990
Cloak? Does anyone need a cloak?

872
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,190
Arendelle is indebted to you,
Your Highness.

873
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,550
The castle is open.

874
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,730
There is soup and hot
glogg in the great hall.

875
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,910
Here, pass these out.

876
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,470
Prince Hans!

877
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,990
Are we expected
to just sit here and freeze

878
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,640
while you give away all
of Arendelle's tradable goods?

879
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,390
Princess Anna has given her orders.

880
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,190
And that's another thing!

881
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,790
Has it dawned on you that your
princess may be conspiring

882
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,110
with a wicked sorceress

883
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,190
to destroy us all?

884
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,970
Do not question the princess.

885
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,470
She left me in charge

886
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,790
and I will not hesitate

887
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,520
to protect Arendelle
from treason.

888
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,270
Treason?

889
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,710
Whoa! Whoa!

890
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,510
Whoa, boy. Easy.

891
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,800
Easy.

892
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,120
It's Princess Anna's horse.

893
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,920
So, where is the princess?

894
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,120
- Where could she be?
- Where is she?

895
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,800
Princess Anna is in trouble.

896
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,150
I need volunteers to go
with me to find her.

897
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,390
- I'll go.
- I volunteer.

898
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,560
I volunteer two men, My Lord.

899
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,490
Be prepared for anything.

900
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,840
And should you
encounter the queen,

901
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,960
you are to put an
end to this winter.

902
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,090
- Do you understand?
- Hmm.

903
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,200
So, how exactly are you
planning to stop this weather?

904
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,080
Oh. I am gonna talk to my sister.

905
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,470
That's your plan?

906
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,350
My ice business is riding on
you talking to your sister?

907
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,760
Yep.

908
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,880
So, you're not at
all afraid of her?

909
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,890
- Why would I be?
- Yeah.

910
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,640
I bet she's the nicest,
gentlest, warmest person ever.

911
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,790
Oh. Look at that.

912
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,200
I've been impaled.

913
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,520
What now?

914
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Mmm...

915
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,790
It's too steep.

916
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,310
I've only got one rope and you
don't know how to climb mountains.

917
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,670
Says who?

918
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,120
Hmm?

919
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,560
What are you doing?

920
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,640
I'm going to see my sister.

921
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,240
You're gonna kill yourself.

922
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,830
I wouldn't put my foot there.

923
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,690
- You're distracting me.
- Or there.

924
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,630
How do you know
Elsa even wants to see you?

925
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,390
All right.
I'm just blocking you out

926
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,250
because I gotta concentrate, here.

927
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,910
You know,
most people who disappear

928
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,450
into the mountains
want to be alone.

929
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,880
Nobody wants to be alone.

930
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,390
Except maybe you.

931
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,640
I'm not alone.
I have friends, remember?

932
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,360
You mean, the love experts?

933
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,560
Yes, the love experts.

934
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,760
Ah...

935
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,090
Please tell me I'm almost there.

936
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,510
Does the air seem a bit
thin to you up here?

937
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,110
Hang on.

938
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,320
Hey, Sven?

939
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,230
Not sure if this is gonna
solve the problem,

940
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,270
but I found a staircase
that leads exactly

941
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,470
where you wanted to go.

942
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,590
Ha-ha! Thank goodness.
Catch!

943
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,880
Thanks. That was like a
crazy trust exercise.

944
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,750
Whoa.

945
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,800
Now, that's ice.

946
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,790
I might cry.

947
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,570
Go ahead. I won't judge.

948
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,750
All right, take it easy, boy.
Come here.

949
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,480
I got you.

950
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,320
Okay.
You stay right here, buddy.

951
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,600
Flawless.

952
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,880
Knock.

953
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,210
Just knock.

954
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,770
Why isn't she knocking?

955
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,160
Do you think she knows
how to knock?

956
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,950
Huh. It opened.

957
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,440
That's a first.

958
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,510
Oh. You should probably
wait out here.

959
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,630
- What?
- The last time I introduced her to a guy,

960
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,990
she froze everything.

961
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,910
But, but... Oh, come on!

962
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,880
It's a palace made of ice.
Ice is my life!

963
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:42,990
Bye, Sven.

964
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,770
You, too, Olaf.

965
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,920
- Me?
- Just give us a minute.

966
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,520
Okay.

967
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,290
One, two,

968
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,720
- three...
- Four...

969
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,280
Whoa.

970
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,560
Elsa?

971
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,440
It's me, Anna.

972
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,960
Anna.

973
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,160
Whoa. Elsa, you look different.

974
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,290
It's a good different.

975
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,920
And this place...

976
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,560
It's amazing.

977
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,880
Thank you.

978
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,280
I never knew what I was capable of.

979
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,470
I'm so sorry about what happened.
If I'd have known...

980
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,800
No, no, no. It's okay.

981
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:40,090
You don't have to apologize,
but you should probably go.

982
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,870
Please.

983
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,240
But I just got here.

984
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,560
You belong down in Arendelle.

985
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,870
So do you.

986
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,200
No, Anna, I belong here.

987
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,400
Alone.

988
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,850
Where I can be who I am
without hurting anybody.

989
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,080
Actually, about that...

990
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,370
- Sixty!
- Wait. What is that?

991
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,520
Hi! I'm Olaf and
I like warm hugs!

992
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,360
Olaf?

993
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,280
Yeah. You built me.

994
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,040
Remember that?

995
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,640
And you're alive?

996
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,600
Um... I think so.

997
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,680
He's just like the one
we built as kids.

998
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,040
Yeah.

999
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,440
Elsa, we were so close.

1000
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,520
We can be like that again.

1001
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,480
- Catch me!
- Slow down!

1002
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,160
Anna!

1003
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,750
No.

1004
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,440
We can't. Goodbye, Anna.

1005
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,550
Elsa, wait.

1006
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,750
No, I'm just trying
to protect you.

1007
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,610
You don't have to protect me.
I'm not afraid.

1008
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,280
Please don't shut me out again.

1009
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,510
<i>Please don't slam the door</i>

1010
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,590
<i>You don't have to keep
Your distance anymore</i>

1011
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,610
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

1012
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,790
<i>I finally understand</i>

1013
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,150
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

1014
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,430
<i>We can fix this hand in hand</i>

1015
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,600
We can head down
this mountain together.

1016
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,630
<i>You don't have to live in fear</i>

1017
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,560
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

1018
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,910
<i>I will be right here</i>

1019
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,190
Anna.

1020
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,110
<i>Please go back home</i>

1021
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,890
<i>Your life awaits</i>

1022
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,230
<i>Go enjoy the sun
And open up the gates</i>

1023
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,710
- Yeah, but...
- I know.

1024
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,050
<i>You mean well
But leave me be</i>

1025
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,550
<i>Yes, I'm alone</i>

1026
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,510
<i>But I'm alone and free</i>

1027
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:40,280
<i>Just stay away
And you'll be safe from me</i>

1028
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,520
<i>Actually, we're not</i>

1029
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,750
<i>What do you mean, you're not?</i>

1030
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,310
<i>I get the feeling you don't know</i>

1031
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,680
<i>What do I not know?</i>

1032
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,390
<i>Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep</i>

1033
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,680
<i>Deep snow</i>

1034
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,040
What?

1035
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,000
You kind of set off an
eternal winter everywhere.

1036
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,350
Everywhere?

1037
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,270
Well, it's okay,
you can just unfreeze it.

1038
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,520
No, I can't. I don't know how.

1039
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,080
Sure you can. I know you can.

1040
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,800
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

1041
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,510
<i>Oh, I'm such a fool!
I can't be free!</i>

1042
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,880
<i>You don't have to be afraid</i>

1043
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,830
<i>No escape from the storm inside of me</i>

1044
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,830
<i>We can work this out together</i>

1045
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,710
<i>I can't control the curse!</i>

1046
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:25,030
<i>We'll reverse the storm you've made</i>

1047
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,110
<i>Anna, please you'll only make it worse!</i>

1048
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,310
<i>Don't panic
There's so much fear!</i>

1049
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,910
<i>We'll make the sun shine bright</i>

1050
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,310
<i>You're not safe here!</i>

1051
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,030
<i>We can face this thing together</i>

1052
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,110
<i>No!</i>

1053
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,270
<i>We can change this winter weather</i>

1054
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,760
<i>And everything will be all right</i>

1055
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,760
<i>I can't!</i>

1056
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,440
Anna!

1057
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,200
Are you okay?

1058
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,470
I'm okay.

1059
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,920
I'm fine.

1060
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,150
Who's this?

1061
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,770
Wait, it doesn't matter. Just...

1062
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,190
You have to go.

1063
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,990
No, I know we can
figure this out together.

1064
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,070
How?

1065
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,440
What power do you have
to stop this winter?

1066
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,040
To stop me?

1067
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,550
Anna, I think we should go.

1068
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,550
No, I'm not leaving
without you, Elsa.

1069
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,440
Yes, you are.

1070
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,790
Stop! Put us down!

1071
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,600
Go away.

1072
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,560
Heads up!

1073
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,430
Watch out for my butt!

1074
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,950
It is not nice to throw people!

1075
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,190
Whoa, whoa, whoa, feisty-pants.
Okay, relax.

1076
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,590
- Just calm down! Calm down!
- Okay! All right!

1077
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,270
- I'm okay.
- Just let the snowman be.

1078
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,590
- I'm calm.
- Great.

1079
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,320
Oh! Come on!

1080
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,830
Oh. Look, see?
Now, you made him mad.

1081
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,800
I'll distract him. You guys go.

1082
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,330
No, no! Not you guys!

1083
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,480
This just got
a whole lot harder.

1084
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,320
Look out!

1085
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,680
Run! Run!

1086
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,760
What are you doing?

1087
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,440
I got him!

1088
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,150
Whoa! Stop!

1089
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,400
It's a 100-foot drop.

1090
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,000
It's 200.

1091
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,520
OW!

1092
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,190
- What's that for?
- I'm digging a snow anchor.

1093
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,890
Okay. What if we fall?

1094
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,110
There's 20 feet of fresh
powder down there.

1095
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,870
It'll be like landing on a pillow.

1096
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,950
Hopefully.

1097
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,190
Okay, Anna. On three.

1098
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,550
- Okay.
- One...

1099
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,630
You tell me when. I'm ready to go.

1100
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,270
- Two...
- I was born ready! Yes!

1101
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,560
Calm down.

1102
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,670
Tree!

1103
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,960
What the... Whoa!

1104
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,600
That happened.

1105
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,510
Man, am I out of shape.

1106
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,510
There we go. Hey, Anna!

1107
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,350
Sven! Where did you guys go?

1108
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,210
We totally lost
Marshmallow back there.

1109
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,030
Hey! We were just
talking about you.

1110
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,200
All good things, all good things.

1111
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,720
No!

1112
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,190
This is not making much
of a difference, is it?

1113
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,790
Olaf!

1114
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,760
Hang in there, guys!

1115
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,950
Go. Go faster!

1116
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,810
- Wait, what?
- Hey!

1117
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,590
Ow!

1118
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,070
Kristoff!

1119
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,800
Don't come back!

1120
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,520
We won't.

1121
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,480
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.

1122
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,880
Olaf!

1123
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,990
I can't feel my legs!
I can't feel my legs!

1124
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,550
- Those are my legs.
- Ooh!

1125
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,070
Hey, do me a favor,
grab my butt.

1126
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,160
Oh. That feels better.

1127
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,920
Hey, Sven! He found us.

1128
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,150
Who's my cute little reindeer?

1129
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,270
Don't talk to him like that.

1130
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,160
You're tickling me.

1131
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,280
Here.

1132
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,590
Whoa!

1133
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,790
Are you okay?

1134
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,360
Thank you.

1135
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,520
- How's your head?
- Ah! Ooh!

1136
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,430
It's fine. Uh...

1137
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,110
Uh, I'm good.
I've got a thick skull.

1138
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,120
I don't have a skull.

1139
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,920
Or bones.

1140
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,640
So, uh... So, now what?

1141
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,790
Now what?

1142
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,190
Now what?

1143
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,480
Oh...

1144
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,040
What am I gonna do?

1145
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,830
She threw me out.

1146
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,190
I can't go back to Arendelle
with the weather like this.

1147
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,270
And then there's your ice business.

1148
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:57,000
Hey, hey.
Don't worry about my ice business.

1149
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,750
- Worry about your hair!
- What?

1150
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,630
I just fell off a cliff.
You should see your hair.

1151
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,350
No, yours is turning white.

1152
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,270
White? It's... What?

1153
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,480
It's because she struck you,
isn't it?

1154
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,690
Does it look bad?

1155
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,030
- No.
- You hesitated.

1156
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,280
No, I didn't.

1157
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,550
Anna, you need help, okay?
Come on.

1158
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,250
Okay! Where are we going?

1159
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,350
To see my friends.

1160
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,670
The love experts?

1161
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,530
- Love experts?
- Uh-huh.

1162
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,150
And don't worry,
they'll be able to fix this.

1163
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,010
How do you know?

1164
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,720
Because I've seen
them do it before.

1165
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,150
I like to consider myself
a love expert.

1166
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,570
Get it together.

1167
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,550
Control it.

1168
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,360
Don't feel. Don't feel.

1169
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,490
Don't feel.

1170
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,320
Don't feel!

1171
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,400
Look, Sven, the sky is awake.

1172
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,560
- Are you cold?
- A little.

1173
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,950
Uh...
Wait. Come here.

1174
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,240
Huh?

1175
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,250
Ooh.

1176
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:21,910
So, uh, about my friends. Well...

1177
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,350
I say "friends"...

1178
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,390
They're more like family.

1179
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,390
Anyway, when I was a kid,
it was just me and Sven.

1180
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,480
Until they, you know,
kinda took us in.

1181
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,360
- They did?
- Yeah.

1182
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,670
I don't want to scare you.

1183
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,110
They can be a little
inappropriate and loud.

1184
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,680
Very loud.

1185
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,670
They are also stubborn at times,

1186
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,950
and a little overbearing.

1187
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,750
And heavy.
Really, really, heavy.

1188
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,110
But you'll get it.
They mean well.

1189
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,440
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

1190
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,970
Okay, then.

1191
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,480
Meet my family.

1192
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,400
Hey, guys.

1193
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,450
They're rocks.

1194
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,790
You are a sight for sore eyes.

1195
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,730
He's crazy.

1196
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,480
Rocko's looking sharp, as usual.

1197
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,910
Clay, whoa...
I don't even recognize you.

1198
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,030
You lost so much weight.

1199
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,990
I'll distract him while you run.

1200
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,120
Hi, Sven's family!

1201
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,800
It's nice to meet you.

1202
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,430
Because I love you,
Anna, I insist you run.

1203
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,530
I understand
you're love experts. Ooh!

1204
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,490
Why aren't you running?

1205
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,790
Uh...

1206
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,280
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go.

1207
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,440
- Go.
- No, no, no. Anna, wait.

1208
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,490
Kristoff!

1209
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,440
Whoa!

1210
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,160
Hey!

1211
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,550
Kristoff's home!

1212
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,830
- Kristoff's here!
- Kristoff's home!

1213
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:51,310
- Wait, "Kristoff"?
- Uh-huh.

1214
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,790
Ah, let me look at you.

1215
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,470
Take off your clothes,
I wash them.

1216
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,360
No! No, I'm going to
keep my clothes on.

1217
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,790
Look, it's great to see you all,

1218
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,030
but where's Granpabbie?

1219
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,150
He's napping.

1220
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,950
But look, I grew a mushroom.

1221
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,550
- I...
- I earned my fire crystal.

1222
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,000
I passed a kidney stone.

1223
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,310
Kristoff, pick me up.

1224
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,590
You're getting big.

1225
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,880
Good for you.

1226
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,560
Trolls. They're trolls!

1227
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,120
He's brought a girl!

1228
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,880
A girl!

1229
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,750
- Whoa!
- Is that a real girl?

1230
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,870
She's like a little cupcake.

1231
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,950
What's going on?

1232
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,280
I've learned to just roll with it.

1233
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,870
Let me see.
Bright eyes, working nose,

1234
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,410
strong teeth!

1235
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,270
Yes, yes. She'll do
nicely for our Kristoff.

1236
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,510
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, um, no.

1237
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,910
- No.
- You've got the wrong idea.

1238
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,070
No. That's not why I
brought her here.

1239
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,950
Right. We're not... I'm not...

1240
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,150
What's the issue, dear?

1241
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:42,310
Why are you holding back
from such a man?

1242
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,320
<i>Is it the clumpy way he walks?</i>

1243
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,670
- What?
<i>- Or the grumpy way he talks?</i>

1244
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,470
- Oh, no.
<i>- Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped</i>

1245
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,030
<i>Weirdness of his feet?</i>

1246
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,150
Hey!

1247
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,110
<i>And though we know he washes well</i>

1248
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,750
<i>He always ends up sort of smelly</i>

1249
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,390
<i>But you'll never meet a fella</i>

1250
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,350
<i>Who's as sensitive and sweet</i>

1251
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,470
That's nice, but...

1252
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,510
<i>So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1253
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,590
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
<i>- So, he's got a few flaws</i>

1254
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,830
<i>Like his peculiar brain, dear</i>

1255
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,990
<i>His thing with the reindeer</i>

1256
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,670
<i>That's a little outside
of nature's laws</i>

1257
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,790
This is not about me!

1258
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,550
<i>So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1259
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,750
<i>But this we're certain of</i>

1260
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,390
<i>You can fix this fixer-upper up</i>

1261
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,190
<i>- With a little bit of love
- Um...</i>

1262
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,230
Can we please
just stop talking about this?

1263
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,470
We've got a real,
actual problem, here.

1264
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,080
I'll say. So, tell me, dear...

1265
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,350
<i>Is it the way that he runs scared?</i>

1266
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,440
<i>Or that he's socially impaired?</i>

1267
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,870
<i>Or that he only likes
To tinkle in the woods?</i>

1268
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:33,990
I did not need to know that.

1269
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,230
<i>Are you holding back your fondness</i>

1270
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,710
<i>Due to his unmanly blondness?</i>

1271
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,400
<i>Or the way he covers up
That he's the honest goods?</i>

1272
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,510
<i>He's just a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1273
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,030
<i>He's got a couple of bugs</i>

1274
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,910
- No, I don't!
<i>- His isolation is confirmation</i>

1275
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,910
<i>- Of his desperation for healing hugs</i>
- Aw.

1276
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,470
<i>So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1277
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,230
<i>But we know what to do</i>

1278
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,270
<i>The way to fix up this fixer-upper</i>

1279
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,830
<i>Is to fix him up with you</i>

1280
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,510
Whoa!

1281
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,160
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Enough!

1282
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,360
She is engaged to
someone else, okay?

1283
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,070
<i>So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1284
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,000
<i>That's a minor thing</i>

1285
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,470
<i>Her quote "engagement"
Is a flex arrangement</i>

1286
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,830
<i>And by the way, I don't see no ring</i>

1287
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,110
<i>So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1288
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,320
- Hey! Whoa, watch it!
<i>- Her brain's a bit betwixt</i>

1289
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,790
<i>Get the fiance out of the way</i>

1290
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,120
<i>And the whole thing will be fixed</i>

1291
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,950
<i>We're not saying you can change him</i>

1292
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,040
<i>'Cause people don't really change</i>

1293
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,670
<i>We're only saying that love's a force</i>

1294
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,030
<i>That's powerful and strange</i>

1295
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,270
<i>People make bad choices</i>

1296
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,680
<i>If they're mad or scared or stressed</i>

1297
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,790
<i>But throw a little love their way</i>

1298
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,150
<i>Throw a little love their way</i>

1299
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,280
<i>And you'll bring out their best</i>

1300
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,680
<i>True love brings out the best</i>

1301
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,360
<i>Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1302
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,310
<i>That's what it's all about</i>

1303
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,390
- Father!
- Sister!

1304
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,190
<i>- Brother!
- We need each other to raise us up</i>

1305
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,560
<i>And round us out</i>

1306
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,950
<i>Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1307
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,470
<i>But when push comes to shove</i>

1308
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,750
<i>The only fixer-upper fixer</i>

1309
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,830
<i>That can fix a fixer-upper is...</i>

1310
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,270
<i>True, true</i>

1311
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,390
<i>True</i>

1312
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,470
<i>Love!</i>

1313
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,830
<i>Love, love, love</i>

1314
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,830
<i>Love
True love</i>

1315
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,990
<i>True</i>

1316
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,190
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff
to be your trollfully wedded...

1317
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,150
- Wait, what?
- You're getting married.

1318
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,310
Love!

1319
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,600
Anna?

1320
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,800
She's as cold as ice.

1321
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,170
There is strange magic here.

1322
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,560
- Granpabbie.
- Come, come. Bring her here to me.

1323
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,720
Anna, your life is in danger.

1324
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:49,320
There is ice in your heart
put there by your sister.

1325
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:54,640
If not removed, to solid ice
will you freeze, forever.

1326
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,230
What? No.

1327
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,670
But you can remove it, right?

1328
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,870
I cannot

1329
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,880
I'm sorry, Kristoff.

1330
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,390
If it was her head,
that would be easy.

1331
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:08,400
But only an act of true love
can thaw a frozen heart.

1332
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,670
An act of true love?

1333
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,160
A true love's kiss, perhaps?

1334
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,270
- Something's wrong.
- Are you all right?

1335
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,870
Anna, we've got to
get you back to Hans.

1336
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:22,990
Hans.

1337
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,200
Pull us out, Sven.

1338
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,350
Olaf, come on!

1339
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,080
I'm coming!

1340
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,360
Let's go kiss Hans!

1341
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,480
Who is this Hans?

1342
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,480
We are here to find
Princess Anna.

1343
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:50,440
Be on guard, but no harm
is to come to the queen.

1344
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:52,870
Do you understand?

1345
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,880
Yes, Your Grace.

1346
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,490
The queen.

1347
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,560
Go, go! Come on!

1348
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,880
There!

1349
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,560
Up there!

1350
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,320
Come on!

1351
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,080
We got her.

1352
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,920
No. Please.

1353
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,530
Go around. Toss it.

1354
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,880
Stay away!

1355
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,320
Look out!

1356
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,830
Fire! Fire!

1357
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,240
Get her!

1358
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,320
Ah!

1359
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,920
Come on!

1360
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,000
Grab his arm.

1361
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,440
Aim...

1362
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,230
This way, this way!

1363
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,440
Whoa!

1364
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,840
Queen Elsa!

1365
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,760
Don't be the monster
they fear you are.

1366
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,920
Oh, no. What have...
What have I done?

1367
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,490
Why did you bring me here?

1368
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,430
I couldn't just let them kill you.

1369
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,760
But I'm a danger to Arendelle.
Get Anna.

1370
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:00,190
Anna has not returned.

1371
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,040
If you would just stop the winter.

1372
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,840
Bring back summer, please.

1373
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,640
Don't you see?

1374
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,280
I can't.

1375
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,280
You have to tell them to let me go.

1376
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,880
I will do what I can.

1377
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,990
Just hang in there.

1378
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,360
Come on, buddy, faster!

1379
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,350
Oh, boy!

1380
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,560
Whoa! I'll meet you
guys at the castle!

1381
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:57,990
Stay out of sight, Olaf.

1382
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,720
I will!

1383
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,160
- Hello!
- It's alive!

1384
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,720
It's Princess Anna!

1385
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,960
Are you gonna be okay?

1386
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,670
Don't worry about me.

1387
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,510
Anna!

1388
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,430
- You had us worried sick.
- My Lady.

1389
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,430
Get her warm. And find
Prince Hans, immediately.

1390
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,050
We will. Thank you.

1391
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,730
Make sure she's safe.

1392
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,670
Oh, you poor girl,
you're freezing.

1393
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:43,080
Oh, let's get you inside now
and get you warm.

1394
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,390
I'm going back out
to look for Princess Anna.

1395
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,250
You cannot risk going
out there again.

1396
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,590
If anything happens to her...

1397
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,560
If anything happens
to the princess,

1398
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:06,120
you are all Arendelle has left.

1399
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,510
He's in here.

1400
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,630
Prince Hans.

1401
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,070
Anna.

1402
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,190
You're so cold.

1403
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,430
- Hans, you have to kiss me.
- What?

1404
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,150
- Now! Now!
- Slow down.

1405
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,080
We'll give you two some privacy.

1406
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,030
What happened out there?

1407
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,120
Elsa struck me with her powers.

1408
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,670
You said she would
never hurt you.

1409
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,750
I was wrong.

1410
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,320
Anna.

1411
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,690
She froze my heart,

1412
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,360
and only an act of true
love can save me.

1413
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,800
A true love's kiss.

1414
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,160
Oh, Anna.

1415
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,550
If only there was someone
out there who loved you.

1416
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,000
What?

1417
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,280
You said you did.

1418
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:03,190
As thirteenth in line in
my own kingdom,

1419
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,470
I didn't stand a chance.

1420
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:08,230
I knew I would have to marry
into the throne somewhere.

1421
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:09,800
What... What are you talking about?

1422
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:12,760
As heir, Elsa was
preferable, of course.

1423
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,830
But no one was getting
anywhere with her.

1424
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:15,910
- But you...
- Hans!

1425
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,430
You were so desperate for love,

1426
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,370
you were willing
to marry me just like that.

1427
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,630
I figured after we married,

1428
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,790
I would have to stage
a little accident for Elsa.

1429
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,040
- Hans!
- No. Stop.

1430
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,150
But then, she doomed herself,

1431
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,110
and you were dumb
enough to go after her.

1432
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,230
Please.

1433
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,920
All that's left now
is to kill Elsa,

1434
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:37,970
and bring back summer.

1435
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,430
You're no match for Elsa.

1436
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,840
No, you're no match for Elsa.

1437
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:44,680
I, on the other hand,

1438
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:49,720
am the hero who is going to save
Arendelle from destruction.

1439
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,010
You won't get away with this.

1440
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,600
Oh...

1441
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,810
I already have.

1442
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,320
Please, somebody, help.

1443
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,120
Please. Please.

1444
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,990
It's getting colder by the minute.

1445
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,710
If we don't do something soon,
we'll all freeze to death.

1446
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,330
Prince Hans.

1447
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,440
Princess Anna is...

1448
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,230
Dead.

1449
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,310
What?

1450
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,010
What happened to her?

1451
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,450
She was killed.

1452
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,070
By Queen Elsa.

1453
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,320
No!

1454
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,680
Her own sister.

1455
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,960
At least we got to say
our marriage vows

1456
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,280
before she died in my arms.

1457
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,730
There can be no doubt now.

1458
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,390
Queen Elsa is a monster,

1459
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,520
and we are all in grave danger.

1460
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:52,920
Prince Hans,

1461
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,480
Arendelle looks to you.

1462
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,710
With a heavy heart,

1463
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:02,890
I charge Queen Elsa
of Arendelle with treason.

1464
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,960
And sentence her to death.

1465
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,480
Hurry up!

1466
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:20,630
She's dangerous.

1467
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,000
- Move quickly.
- Careful.

1468
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,250
- It won't open!
- It's frozen shut.

1469
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,680
Put your back into it!

1470
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,270
Come on! Push!

1471
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,550
What is it, buddy?

1472
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,200
Hey, watch it.

1473
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,760
What's wrong with you?

1474
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,280
I don't understand you
when you talk like that.

1475
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,070
Stop it! Put me down!

1476
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,630
No, Sven!

1477
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,230
We're not going back.

1478
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:13,930
She's with her true love.

1479
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:21,920
What the...

1480
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,840
Anna!

1481
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,680
Come on! Come on, boy.

1482
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:52,880
Help.

1483
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,520
Anna!

1484
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,680
Oh, no.

1485
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,080
Olaf?

1486
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,480
Olaf. Get away from there.

1487
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,160
Wow!

1488
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,910
So, this is heat.

1489
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,430
I love it.

1490
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,210
Ooh! But don't touch it.

1491
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:36,440
So, where's Hans?
What happened to your kiss?

1492
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:40,800
I was wrong about him.
It wasn't true love.

1493
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,720
But we ran all the way here.

1494
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:46,230
Please, Olaf, you can't stay here.
You'll melt.

1495
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:47,350
I am not leaving here until

1496
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,130
we find some other act
of true love to save you.

1497
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,360
Do you happen to have any ideas?

1498
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,410
I don't even know what love is.

1499
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,480
That's okay, I do.

1500
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,280
Love is

1501
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,640
putting someone else's
needs before yours.

1502
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:06,210
Like, you know, how Kristoff brought you
back here to Hans and left you forever.

1503
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,520
Kristoff loves me?

1504
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,600
Wow, you really don't know
anything about love, do you?

1505
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,920
Olaf, you're melting.

1506
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,400
Some people are
worth melting for.

1507
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,640
Just maybe not
right this second.

1508
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,280
Don't worry, I've got it.

1509
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,920
We're gonna get through... Oh, wait.

1510
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,690
Hang on,
I'm getting something.

1511
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,150
It's Kristoff and Sven!

1512
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,560
They're coming back this way.

1513
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,360
They... They are?

1514
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:48,160
Wow! He's really moving fast.

1515
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,630
I guess I was wrong.

1516
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:52,200
I guess Kristoff doesn't love you
enough to leave you behind.

1517
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,830
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

1518
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,990
No, no, no! You need to
stay by the fire and keep warm.

1519
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,750
I need to get to Kristoff.

1520
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,040
Why?

1521
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:03,950
Oh, I know why!

1522
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,150
There's your act of
true love right there!

1523
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:10,150
Riding across the fjords like a
valiant, pungent reindeer king!

1524
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,640
Come on!

1525
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,510
Look out!

1526
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,960
Oh!

1527
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,370
Uh... Back this way.

1528
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,250
We're trapped.

1529
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,880
Oh...

1530
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,410
Whoa!

1531
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,130
Slide, Anna!

1532
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,570
We made it!

1533
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,330
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1534
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:19,570
Come on, buddy, faster.

1535
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,410
Kristoff!

1536
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,640
Keep going!

1537
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,480
Kristoff!

1538
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,160
Come on!

1539
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:02,560
No.

1540
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:18,840
Whoa!

1541
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,050
Whoa!

1542
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,010
Sven... Sven!

1543
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,960
Good boy.

1544
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,770
Kristoff.

1545
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,600
- Kristoff...
- Anna...

1546
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,600
Anna!

1547
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:07,360
Elsa! You can't run from this!

1548
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,630
Just take care of my sister.

1549
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,270
Your sister?

1550
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,920
She returned from the mountain
weak and cold.

1551
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:18,230
She said that you
froze her heart.

1552
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,390
No.

1553
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,640
I tried to save her,
but it was too late.

1554
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:25,440
Her skin was ice.
Her hair turned white.

1555
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,570
Your sister is dead.

1556
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,990
Because of you.

1557
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,240
No.

1558
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,520
Kristoff.

1559
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,450
Anna!

1560
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,400
Elsa?

1561
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:21,800
No!

1562
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,400
Anna!

1563
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,850
Oh. Anna!

1564
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,800
No, no!

1565
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,440
Please, no.

1566
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:52,200
Anna?

1567
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:34,210
Anna?

1568
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,880
Oh, Elsa.

1569
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,400
You sacrificed yourself for me?

1570
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,510
I love you.

1571
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:49,440
"An act of true love
will thaw a frozen heart."

1572
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,690
"Love will thaw."

1573
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,430
Love. Of course.

1574
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:57,720
Elsa?

1575
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,440
Love!

1576
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,690
I knew you could do it.

1577
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:51,440
Hands down, this is the
best day of my life.

1578
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,750
And, quite possibly, the last.

1579
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,280
Oh, Olaf! Hang on, little guy.

1580
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,250
Oh, Oh, Oh!

1581
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:03,440
My own personal flurry!

1582
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,770
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

1583
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:13,840
Anna?

1584
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,840
But she froze your heart.

1585
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,770
The only frozen heart
around here is yours.

1586
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,720
Wonderful!

1587
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,200
Setting course, sir.

1588
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,830
I will return this
scoundrel to his country.

1589
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:49,760
We shall see what his 12 big
brothers think of his behavior.

1590
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:51,470
Arendelle thanks you, milord.

1591
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,310
This is unacceptable.

1592
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:56,470
I am a victim of fear.
I've been traumatized.

1593
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,360
Ah! My neck hurts.

1594
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:02,030
Is there a doctor that I could see?

1595
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,430
And I demand to see the queen!

1596
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,640
Oh. I have a message
from the queen.

1597
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,910
"Arendelle will henceforth
and forever

1598
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:13,040
"no longer do business of
any sort with Weaseltown."

1599
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,230
"Weselton."

1600
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,790
- It's Weselton!
- Let's go.

1601
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:16,910
Come on, come on, come on!

1602
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,390
Okay, okay, here I come.

1603
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:21,480
- Pole!
- Whoops! Sorry.

1604
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:23,210
Okay, Okay.

1605
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:25,040
Here we are. Oh!

1606
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,360
I owe you a sled.

1607
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,200
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

1608
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,990
And it's the latest model.

1609
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,590
No, I can't accept this.

1610
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,560
You have to. No returns.
No exchanges. Queen's orders.

1611
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:44,520
She's named you the Official
Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.

1612
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:46,510
- What? That's not a thing.
- Oh, sure it is.

1613
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:50,030
And it even has a cup holder.
Do you like it?

1614
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,350
Like it? I love it!

1615
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,430
Whoa.

1616
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:55,290
I could kiss you!

1617
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,870
I could. I mean,
I'd like to. I'd...

1618
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:00,070
May I? We me.
I mean, may we?

1619
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,320
Wait, what?

1620
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,560
We may.

1621
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,880
Mmm.

1622
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,920
Summer!

1623
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,790
Ooh...

1624
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,870
Hello.

1625
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,230
Are you ready?

1626
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,280
Ice!

1627
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,470
Ooh! Whoo-hoo...

1628
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,120
Swing me.

1629
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:56,800
Ooh...

1630
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,750
I like the open gates.

1631
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:01,120
We are never closing them again.

1632
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:06,120
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,
but you know I don't skate.

1633
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:07,730
Come on! You can do it!

1634
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:10,350
Look out.
Reindeer coming through.

1635
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:12,110
I got it, I got it.
I don't got it, I don't got it.

1636
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:13,190
Hey, guys!

1637
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,510
That's it, Olaf.

1638
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,830
Glide and pivot.
And glide and pivot.

1639
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,480
Go.

1640
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,400
Oh!
